    In this paper, the \abfbai{} engine is implemented with C++ language, and the build environment is Microsoft Visual Studio 2015.\pause

    To demonstrate the ability to adjust the risk value in real-time with the launching of multi-step attacks, in the first simulation, an imaginary attack scenario is proposed. \pause From the 49th minute to the 81st minute, the attacker scans the network of the Ethernet; \pause from the 90th minute to the 142nd minute, the attacker scans the vulnerabilities of the devices in the Ethernet; \pause from the 163rd minute to the 204th minute, the attacker launches the DoS attack to the HDS.

    To verify the efficiency of noise reduction, a contrast simulation is designed. The following figure shows the program of the contrast simulation.

    To demonstrate the execution time of our approach, another simulation is designed. In the second simulation, the set $\bm{\alpha}$'s size $n = 10$, the maximum number of iterations $t_{\max} = 100$, the accuracy $\lthreshold = 1\times 10^{-4}$, the inference process is repeated 5,000 times. The distribution curve of the execution time is shown in the following figure.

    To show the possible upper/lower bounds and the scalability of our approach, the fourth simulation is implemented. \uncover<2->{In this simulation, for each number of interval values $N \in \{5, 10, 20, 30, \cdots, 100\}$, the Bayesian network is inferred 5,000 times with stochastic evidence set.} \uncover<3->{All the execution times are recorded, and the following figure shows the possible upper/lower bounds and the scalability of the proposed risk assessment approach.}
