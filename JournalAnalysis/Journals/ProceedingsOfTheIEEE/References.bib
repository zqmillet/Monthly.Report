  Abstract                 = {With a goal of identifying biomarkers/patterns related to certain conditions or diseases, metabolomics focuses on the detection of chemical substances in biological samples such as urine and blood using a number of analytical techniques, including nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS), and fluorescence spectroscopy. Data sets measured using these methods provide partly complementary information, and their joint analysis has the potential to reveal underlying structures, which are, otherwise, difficult to extract. While we can collect vast amounts of data using different analytical methods, data fusion remains a challenging task, in particular, when the goal is to capture the underlying factors and use them for interpretation, e.g., for biomarker identification. Furthermore, many data fusion applications require joint analysis of heterogeneous (i.e., in the form of higher order tensors and matrices) data sets with shared/unshared factors. In order to jointly analyze such heterogeneous data sets, we formulate data fusion as a coupled matrix and tensor factorization (CMTF) problem, which has already proved useful in many data mining applications, and discuss its extension to a structure-revealing data fusion model, i.e., a data fusion model that can identify shared and unshared factors. The traditional methods commonly used for data fusion in the presence of shared/unshared factors are matrix factorization-based methods. Using both simulations and prototypical experimental coupled data sets, we assess the performance of various state-of-the-art data fusion methods and demonstrate that while matrix factorization-based approaches have limitations when used for joint analysis of heterogeneous data sets, the structure-revealing CMTF model can successfully capture the underlying factors by exploiting the low-rank structure of higher order data sets.},

  Abstract                 = {Fusion of information from multiple sets of data in order to extract a set of features that are most useful and relevant for the given task is inherent to many problems we deal with today. Since, usually, very little is known about the actual interaction among the data sets, it is highly desirable to minimize the underlying assumptions. This has been the main reason for the growing importance of data-driven methods, and in particular of independent component analysis (ICA) as it provides useful decompositions with a simple generative model and using only the assumption of statistical independence. A recent extension of ICA, independent vector analysis (IVA), generalizes ICA to multiple data sets by exploiting the statistical dependence across the data sets, and hence, as we discuss in this paper, provides an attractive solution to fusion of data from multiple data sets along with ICA. In this paper, we focus on two multivariate solutions for multimodal data fusion that let multiple modalities fully interact for the estimation of underlying features that jointly report on all modalities. One solution is the joint ICA model that has found wide application in medical imaging, and the second one is the transposed IVA model introduced here as a generalization of an approach based on multiset canonical correlation analysis. In the discussion, we emphasize the role of diversity in the decompositions achieved by these two models, and present their properties and implementation details to enable the user make informed decisions on the selection of a model along with its associated parameters. Discussions are supported by simulation results to help highlight the main issues in the implementation of these methods.},

  Abstract                 = {The joint independent component analysis (jICA) and the transposed independent vector analysis (tIVA) models are two effective solutions based on blind source separation (BSS) that enable fusion of data from multiple modalities in a symmetric and fully multivariate manner. The previous paper in this special issue discusses the properties and the main issues in the implementation of these two models. In this accompanying paper, we consider the application of these two models to fusion of multimodal medical imaging data-functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI), structural MRI (sMRI), and electroencephalography (EEG) data collected from a group of healthy controls and patients with schizophrenia performing an auditory oddball task. We show how both models can be used to identify a set of components that report on differences between the two groups, jointly, for all the modalities used in the study. We discuss the importance of algorithm and order selection as well as tradeoffs involved in the selection of one model over another. We note that for the selected data set, especially given the limited number of subjects available for the study, jICA provides a more desirable solution, however the use of an ICA algorithm that uses flexible density matching provides advantages over the most widely used algorithm, Infomax, for the problem.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the biggest challenges in cyber-physical system (CPS) design is their intrinsic complexity, heterogeneity, and multidisciplinary nature. Emerging distributed CPSs integrate a wide range of heterogeneous aspects such as physical dynamics, control, machine learning, and error handling. Furthermore, system components are often distributed over multiple physical locations, hardware platforms, and communication networks. While model-based design (MBD) has tremendously improved the design process, CPS design remains a difficult task. Models are meant to improve understanding of a system, yet this quality is often lost when models become too complicated. In this paper, we show how to use aspect-oriented (AO) modeling techniques in MBD as a systematic way to segregate domains of expertise and cross-cutting concerns within the model. We demonstrate these concepts on actor-oriented models of an industrial robotic swarm application and illustrate the use of AO modeling techniques to manage the complexity. We also show how to use AO modeling for design-space exploration.},

We demonstrate that new logic synthesis techniques, natively supporting this abstraction, are the technology enablers. We describe models and data-structures for logic design using emerging technologies and we show results of applying new synthesis algorithms and tools.

  Abstract                 = {Current rehabilitation therapies for stroke rely on physical practice (PP) by the patients. Motor imagery (MI), the imagination of movements without physical action, presents an alternate neurorehabilitation for stroke patients without relying on residue movements. However, MI is an endogenous mental process that is not physically observable. Recently, advances in brain-computer interface (BCI) technology have enabled the objective detection of MI that spearheaded this alternate neurorehabilitation for stroke. In this review, we present two strategies of using BCI for neurorehabilitation after stroke: detecting MI to trigger a feedback, and detecting MI with a robot to provide concomitant MI and PP. We also present three randomized control trials that employed these two strategies for upper limb rehabilitation. A total of 125 chronic stroke patients were screened over six years. The BCI screening revealed that 103 (82%) patients can use electroencephalogram-based BCI, and 75 (60%) performed well with accuracies above 70%. A total of 67 patients were recruited to complete one of the three RCTs ranging from two to six weeks of which 26 patients, who underwent BCI neurorehabilitation that employed these two strategies, had significant motor improvement of 4.5 measured by Fugl-Meyer Motor Assessment of the upper extremity. Hence, the results demonstrate clinical efficacy of using BCI as an alternate neurorehabilitation for stroke.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-scale data analysis poses both statistical and computational problems which need to be addressed simultaneously. A solution is often straightforward if the data are homogeneous: one can use classical ideas of subsampling and mean aggregation to get a computationally efficient solution with acceptable statistical accuracy, where the aggregation step simply averages the results obtained on distinct subsets of the data. However, if the data exhibit inhomogeneities (and typically they do), the same approach will be inadequate, as it will be unduly influenced by effects that are not persistent across all the data due to, for example, outliers or time-varying effects. We show that a tweak to the aggregation step can produce an estimator of effects which are common to all data, and hence interesting for interpretation and often leading to better prediction than pooled effects.},

Commercial heating, ventilation, and air conditioning (HVAC) loads are potential candidates for providing such demand-response (DR) services as they consume significant energy and because of the temporal flexibility offered by their inherent thermal inertia. Several ancillary services markets have recently opened up to participation by DR resources, provided they can satisfy certain performance metrics. We discuss different control strategies for providing frequency regulation DR from commercial HVAC systems and components, and compare performance results from experiments and simulation. We also present experimental results from a single ~30 000-m2 office building and quantify the DR control performance using standardized performance criteria. Additionally, we evaluate the cost of delivering this service by comparing the energy consumed while providing DR against a counterfactual baseline.},

  Abstract                 = {Statistical estimation in many contemporary settings involves the acquisition, analysis, and aggregation of data sets from multiple sources, which can have significant differences in character and in value. Due to these variations, the effectiveness of employing a given resource, e.g., a sensing device or computing power, for gathering or processing data from a particular source depends on the nature of that source. As a result, the appropriate division and assignment of a collection of resources to a set of data sources can substantially impact the overall performance of an inferential strategy. In this expository article, we adopt a general view of the notion of a resource and its effect on the quality of a data source, and we describe a framework for the allocation of a given set of resources to a collection of sources in order to optimize a specified metric of statistical efficiency. We discuss several stylized examples involving inferential tasks such as parameter estimation and hypothesis testing based on heterogeneous data sources, in which optimal allocations can be computed either in closed form or via efficient numerical procedures based on convex optimization. This work is an inferential analog of the literature in information theory on allocating power across communications channels of variable quality in order to optimize for total throughput.},

  Abstract                 = {Freight transportation is of outmost importance in our society and is continuously increasing. At the same time, transporting goods on roads accounts for about 26% of the total energy consumption and 18% of all greenhouse gas emissions in the European Union. Despite the influence the transportation system has on our energy consumption and the environment, road transportation is mainly done by individual long-haulage trucks with no real-time coordination or global optimization. In this paper, we review how modern information and communication technology supports a cyber-physical transportation system architecture with an integrated logistic system coordinating fleets of trucks traveling together in vehicle platoons. From the reduced air drag, platooning trucks traveling close together can save about 10% of their fuel consumption. Utilizing road grade information and vehicle-to-vehicle communication, a safe and fuel-optimized cooperative look-ahead control strategy is implemented on top of the existing cruise controller. By optimizing the interaction between vehicles and platoons of vehicles, it is shown that significant improvements can be achieved. An integrated transport planning and vehicle routing in the fleet management system allows both small and large fleet owners to benefit from the collaboration. A realistic case study with 200 heavy-duty vehicles performing transportation tasks in Sweden is described. Simulations show overall fuel savings at more than 5% thanks to coordinated platoon planning. It is also illustrated how well the proposed cooperative look-ahead controller for heavy-duty vehicle platoons manages to optimize the velocity profiles of the vehicles over a hilly segment of the considered road network.},

  Abstract                 = {The Danish grid is moving from a system based on centralized fossil-fueled power plants to a system based on renewable energy where wind is a major energy source. This raises a number of challenges. A main challenge is that the centralized power plants currently are the main providers of reserve power. Alternative sources of flexibility are consequently needed as the conventional power plants are being replaced with fluctuating renewable energy sources. In this paper, we present results from two key demonstrations which illustrate that alternative sources of flexibility exist and that this flexibility can be utilized for reserve power. In the first demonstration, a portfolio of inhabited households heated with heat pumps are remotely monitored and controlled such that the aggregate consumption follows a power reference. This experiment is conducted over a full week where an hourly power reference is tracked while the comfort of the inhabitants is ensured. In the second demonstration, an operational wind power plant is regulated to provide a system-stabilizing response. This experiment is conduced over a 2-h period where the wind power plant follows a 5-min power reference. Together, the two demonstrations illustrate that both consumption and fluctuating production can contribute as sources of reserve power and a sustainable alternative to conventional fossil-fueled power plants in the future grid.},

  Abstract                 = {The renewed interest for physical-layer security techniques has put forward a new role for error-control codes. In addition to ensuring reliability, carefully designed codes have been shown to provide a level of information-theoretic secrecy, by which the amount of information leaked to an adversary may be controlled. The ability to achieve information-theoretic secrecy relies on the study of alternative coding mechanisms, such as channel resolvability and privacy amplification, in which error-control codes are exploited as a means to shape the distribution of stochastic processes. This use of error-control codes, which goes much beyond that of correcting errors, creates numerous new design challenges. The objective of this paper is threefold. First, the paper aims at providing system engineers with explicit tools to build simple secrecy codes in order to stimulate interest and foster their integration in communication system prototypes. Second, it aims at providing coding and information theorists with a synthetic overview of the theoretical concepts and techniques for secrecy.

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the optimal design of phased arrays for medical applications of microwaves, such as hyperthermia treatments and cancer imaging. To address this problem, microwave engineers have to face peculiar and novel challenges, since the region of interest is a 3-D domain in the near field of the array and consists of a highly heterogeneous and lossy medium, whose characteristics change from patient to patient. For this reason, we have to reconsider basic fundamentals about phased array design, in order to devise proper tools and criteria. In particular, we address the design of the system layout, i.e., the choice of the number and locations of the array elements, as this represents the preliminary fundamental problem to face. To this end, we first formulate the two general problems relevant to biomedical applications-the design of an array for therapeutic purposes and of an array for diagnostic/imaging goals. We then address the proper theoretical and analytic tools and methods that enable pursuit of an optimal design with respect to given constraints. Finally, we provide some examples to show how the design procedure can be carried out in practice.},

Extension of wholesale high-voltage power markets to allow distribution network connected prosumers to participate, albeit desirable, has stalled on high transaction costs and the lack of a tractable market clearing framework. This paper presents a distributed, massively parallel architecture that enables tractable transmission and distribution locational marginal price (T&DLMP) discovery along with optimal scheduling of centralized generation, decentralized conventional and flexible loads, and distributed energy resources (DERs). DERs include distributed generation; electric vehicle (EV) battery charging and storage; heating, ventilating, and air conditioning (HVAC) and combined heat & power (CHP) microgenerators; computing; volt/var control devices; grid-friendly appliances; smart transformers; and more. The proposed iterative distributed architecture can discover T&DLMPs while capturing the full complexity of each participating DER's intertemporal preferences and physical system dynamics.},

  Abstract                 = {By the end of the 20th century, the continuous progress of the semiconductor industry brought a major transformation in the design of integrated circuits: as the speed of global wires could not keep up with the speed of ever-smaller transistors, the digital chip became a distributed system. This fact broke the synchronous paradigm assumption, i.e., the foundation of those computer-aided design (CAD) flows which had made possible three decades of unique technology progress: from chips with thousands of transistors to systems on chips (SoCs) with over a billion transistors. Latency-insensitive design (LID) is a correct-by-construction design methodology that was originally developed to address this challenge while preserving as much as possible the synchronous assumption. A broad new approach that transforms the fundamentals of how complex digital systems are assembled, LID introduces the protocols and shells paradigm, which offers several main benefits: modularity (by reconciling the synchronous paradigm with the dominant impact of global interconnect delays that characterizes nanometer technologies), scalability (by making key properties of the design be correct by construction through interface synthesis), flexibility (by simplifying the design and validation of a system through the separation of communication from computation), and efficiency (by enabling the reuse of predesigned components, thus reducing the overall design time). This paper overviews the principles and practice of LID, offers a retrospective on related research over the past decade, and looks ahead in proposing the protocols and shells paradigm as the foundation to bridge the gap between system-level and logic/physical design, a requisite to cope with the complexity of engineering future SoC platforms.},

In response to this, ongoing efforts in developing ship design tools are directed toward making more information available sooner and pushing decision points later. The integrated nature of electric ship in which performance of support systems directly affects performance of primary mission systems compounds this concern; design and simulation of support systems are needed earlier, and collaborative design among multiple engineering disciplines is required in the process. This paper reviews the Navy ship design process and recent developments in ship design tools to illuminate the areas in which further development is necessary.},

This paper presents the coupling of power systems, buildings, communications, and control under a master algorithm. There are two objectives: first, to use a modular architecture for VirGIL, based on the functional mockup interface (FMI), where several different modules can be added, exchanged, and tested; and second, to use a commercial power system simulation platform, familiar to power system operators, such as DIgSILENT PowerFactory. This will help reduce the barriers to the industry for adopting such platforms, investigate and subsequently deploy DR strategies in their daily operation. VirGIL further introduces the integration of the quantized state system (QSS) methods for simulation in this cosimulation platform. Results on how these systems interact using a real network and consumption data are also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The usefulness of the information contained in biomedical data relies heavily on the reliability and accuracy of the methods used for its extraction. The conventional assumptions of stationarity and autonomicity break down in the case of living systems because they are thermodynamically open, and thus constantly interacting with their environments. This leads to an inherent time-variability and results in highly nonlinear, time-dependent dynamics. The aim of signal analysis usually is to gain insight into the behavior of the system from which the signal originated. Here, a range of signal analysis methods is presented and applied to extract information about time-varying oscillatory modes and their interactions. Methods are discussed for the characterization of signals and their underlying nonautonomous dynamics, including time-frequency analysis, decomposition, coherence analysis and dynamical Bayesian inference to study interactions and coupling functions. They are illustrated by being applied to cardiovascular and EEG data. The recent introduction of chronotaxic systems provides a theoretical framework within which dynamical systems can have amplitudes and frequencies which are time-varying, yet remain stable, matching well the characteristics of life. We demonstrate that, when applied in the context of chronotaxic systems, the methods presented facilitate the accurate extraction of the system dynamics over many scales of time and space.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet of Things (IoT) offers the user seamless interoperability and connectivity between devices, systems, services, disparate networks, and in particular control systems. End users expect to connect quickly and transparently via any endpoint device, be it a phone, tablet, wearable, TV, car, or other system that is Internet enabled. Smart IoT devices can serve as versatile control system interfaces, allowing for rapid response and potentially ubiquitous access. However, these devices can present significant security challenges. Using these technologies for user access control at IoT endpoints is vulnerable to replay, man-in-the-middle, and denial-of-service attacks. This paper presents a model that combines the capabilities of smart IoT devices with control system gateways using real-time challenge response for secure control operations. The proposed solution using both endpoint and gateway devices employs a mix of compute, cryptography, signal/image processing, and communication capabilities for authentication and authorization functions. We propose a model that is more secure, scalable, and resilient with real-time performance as compared to traditional approaches. We also provide an example IoT architecture, by showing an overview of Intel's IoT framework for control system gateways currently deployed in control, manufacturing, transportation, and retail tracking environments.},

  Abstract                 = {The advancement in wireless communications requires the integration of multiple radios into a single platform to maximize connectivity. In this paper, the design process of reconfigurable antennas is discussed. Reconfigurable antennas are proposed to cover different wireless services that operate over a wide frequency range. They show significant promise in addressing new system requirements. They exhibit the ability to modify their geometries and behavior to adapt to changes in surrounding conditions. Reconfigurable antennas can deliver the same throughput as a multiantenna system. They use dynamically variable and adaptable single-antenna geometry without increasing the real estate required to accommodate multiple antennas. The optimization of reconfigurable antenna design and operation by removing unnecessary redundant switches to alleviate biasing issues and improve the system's performance is discussed. Controlling the antenna reconfiguration by software, using Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs) or microcontrollers is introduced herein. The use of Neural Networks and its integration with graph models on programmable platforms and its effect on the operation of reconfigurable antennas is presented. Finally, the applications of reconfigurable antennas for cognitive radio, Multiple Input Multiple Output (MIMO) channels, and space applications are highlighted.},

The advent of a full power electronics power system has raised new questions from the point of view of system dynamics, particularly when dealing with the new medium-voltage direct current distribution. The overall goal of guaranteeing a secure operation of the power system has brought researchers to consider two main approaches: reducing the dynamics of the large load to operate in a range of dynamics compatible with traditional generation systems, or making the generator set smarter through its power electronics interface. This paper compares these approaches to stable operation, focusing on the latter considered more in line with the progress of technology and in general more appealing.},

All disciplines have developed their respective sets of analytic tools to fuse the information that is available in all measured modalities. In this paper, we provide a review of classical as well as recent machine learning methods (specifically factor models) for fusing information from functional neuroimaging techniques such as: LFP, EEG, MEG, fNIRS, and fMRI. Early and late fusion scenarios are distinguished, and appropriate factor models for the respective scenarios are presented along with example applications from selected multimodal neuroimaging studies. Further emphasis is given to the interpretability of the resulting model parameters, in particular by highlighting how factor models relate to physical models needed for source localization. The methods we discuss allow for the extraction of information from neural data, which ultimately contributes to 1) better neuroscientific understanding; 2) enhance diagnostic performance; and 3) discover neural signals of interest that correlate maximally with a given cognitive paradigm. While we clearly study the multimodal functional neuroimaging challenge, the discussed machine learning techniques have a wide applicability, i.e., in general data fusion, and may thus be informative to the general interested reader.},

Significant attention has been paid to the ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂBig ThreeÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ infectious pathogens-human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, and tuberculosis (TB)-but other conditions such as Chagas' disease, dengue, Ebola, and typhoid, as well as multipathogen processes such as viral hepatitis, pneumonia, and diarrhea, also have major global impact. Addressing these significant disease burdens, which disproportionately impact the world's poorest regions, is a multifaceted grand challenge, requiring new solutions and new technologies. Diagnostics enabled by advances in microfluidics and nanotechnologies can be an important part of the solution. Advantages such as smaller sample size, increased sensitivity, and new multiplexed sensing modalities in a point-of-care format can allow rapid dissemination of test results in remote and resource-limited regions. In this review, we provide a critical assessment of the state-of-the-art in use of these technologies for detection of HIV, malaria, and TB. In addition to discussing opportunities and future prospects, we also discuss the need for additional governmental and nongovernmental funding sources to develop these technologies to their fullest potential, and the need for new business models to enable their commercialization and deployment.},

The fundamental unretrievability of some forms of information from quantum memory enable unique capabilities that enhance privacy and security. Unique correlations between quantum bits, referred to as quantum entanglement, enable fundamentally faster algorithms for important computational problems. Quantum bits are very delicate, and require extraordinarily low noise levels in order that they can be stored successfully. However, the long-term storage of quantum information is not hopeless, with relatively new discoveries of unique features of quantum entanglement showing that effective use of redundancy should make possible the solution of the quantum memory problem. Laboratory capabilities are just starting to make it possible to test these ideas, and a clear concept of the architectural solutions to scalable quantum computing is emerging.},

  Abstract                 = {The survey paper on hardware for computer security by Rajendran et al. that immediately follows this prolog touches upon - albeit not explicitly - on two important trends in the evolution of electronic and networking technologies. The first of them is the rapidly dwindling dimensions of electronic components. The second is the utmost urgency with which hardware locks are needed for ensuring computer security and the strategic roles they play in national defense and our financial safety. It may thus be worthwhile to spend few moments on these two trends before we hand over the reader to the survey of the work that are being done on several types of such hardware components. Among the components that can fortify computer security there is a relatively new entrant known as the memristor (contraction of memory resistor). It can however be realized on a nanometeric scale (10-9 of a meter) and it exhibits properties not encountered in other hardware elements hitherto. The combination of its small size and the special properties makes it a highly desirable candidate for use in security hardware. To comprehend the physical measurements of a memristor made to a scale of a billionth of a meter (a nanometer) we have to think of the comparable dimensions of a miniscule DNA strand in our own bodies. The tiny new player, theoretically conceived in 1971, 40 plus years later created at Hewlett Packard Research Labs, Palo Alto, Calif. and first publicly announced in 2008 in Nature, may soon change the established circuit design not only for security but for many other electronic circuits as well. It would thus be proper to briefly describe the concept and the operation of the memristor in this prolog.},

  Abstract                 = {Driven by the advent of sophisticated and ubiquitous applications, and the ever-growing need for information, wireless networks are without a doubt steadily evolving into profoundly more complex and dynamic systems. The user demands are progressively rampant, while application requirements continue to expand in both range and diversity. Future wireless networks, therefore, must be equipped with the ability to handle numerous, albeit challenging, requirements. Network reconfiguration, considered as a prominent network paradigm, is envisioned to play a key role in leveraging future network performance and considerably advancing current user experiences. This paper presents a comprehensive overview of reconfigurable wireless networks and an in-depth analysis of reconfiguration at all layers of the protocol stack. Such networks characteristically possess the ability to reconfigure and adapt their hardware and software components and architectures, thus enabling flexible delivery of broad services, as well as sustaining robust operation under highly dynamic conditions. The paper offers a unifying framework for research in reconfigurable wireless networks. This should provide the reader with a holistic view of concepts, methods, and strategies in reconfigurable wireless networks. Focus is given to reconfigurable systems in relatively new and emerging research areas such as cognitive radio networks, cross-layer reconfiguration, and software-defined networks. In addition, modern networks have to be intelligent and capable of self-organization. Thus, this paper discusses the concept of network intelligence as a means to enable reconfiguration in highly complex and dynamic networks. Key processes in network intelligence, such as reasoning, learning, and context awareness, are presented to illustrate how these methods can take reconfiguration to a new level. Finally, the paper is supported with several examples and case studies showing the tremendous impact of reconfiguration- on wireless networks.},

In the field of wave physics, the damping of harmonic oscillations in time and/or space is associated with losses in a dissipative system. Moreover, in open systems, oscillation energy gradually gets lost in the form of radiation toward the remote boundaries of an open region, reducing the amplitude of oscillations, even in a nondissipative system. This effect occurs with radioactive states in quantum mechanics, with damped resonances in open acoustic or electromagnetic cavities, and with leaky-waves in open waveguiding structures.

  Abstract                 = {Motor units are the smallest functional units of our movements. The study of their activation provides a window into the mechanisms of neural control of movement in humans. The classic methods for motor unit investigations date to several decades ago. They are based on invasive recordings with selective needle or wire electrodes. Conversely, the noninvasive (surface) EMG has been commonly processed as an interference signal, with the extraction of its global characteristics, e.g., amplitude. These characteristics, however, are only crudely associated to the underlying motor unit activities. In the last decade, methods have been proposed for reliably extracting individual motor unit activities from the interference surface EMG signal. We describe these methods in this review, with a focus on blind source separation (BSS) and techniques used on decomposed EMG signals. For example, from the motor unit discharge timings, information can be extracted regarding the synaptic input received by the corresponding motor neurons. In reviewing these methods, we also provide examples of applications in representative conditions, such as pathological tremor. In conclusion, we provide an overview of processing methods of the surface EMG signal that allow a reliable characterization of individual motor units in vivo in humans.},

  Abstract                 = {Brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are successfully used in scientific, therapeutic and other applications. Remaining challenges are among others a low signal-to-noise ratio of neural signals, lack of robustness for decoders in the presence of inter-trial and inter-subject variability, time constraints on the calibration phase and the use of BCIs outside a controlled lab environment. Recent advances in BCI research addressed these issues by novel combinations of complementary analysis as well as recording techniques, so called hybrid BCIs. In this paper, we review a number of data fusion techniques for BCI along with hybrid methods for BCI that have recently emerged. Our focus will be on sensorimotor rhythm-based BCIs. We will give an overview of the three main lines of research in this area, integration of complementary features of neural activation, integration of multiple previous sessions and of multiple subjects, and show how these techniques can be used to enhance modern BCI systems.},

A more robust, adaptable, and scalable infrastructure would improve the capability to respond to epidemics. Because engineers contribute to the design and implementation of infrastructure, there are opportunities for innovative solutions to infectious disease response within existing systems that have utility, and therefore resources, before a public health emergency. Examples of innovative leveraging of infrastructure, technologies to enhance existing disease management strategies, engineering approaches to accelerate the rate of discovery and application of scientific, clinical, and public health information, and ethical issues that need to be addressed for implementation are presented.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the most widely-known techniques for securing a message from eavesdropping, is the famous one-time pad. Although the one-time pad offers unconditional security, it has limited applicability today, because it requires that to communicate, two parties already share a key that is not known by the eavesdropper and has size equal to the message. In this review paper we present a line of work that explores how we can efficiently share keys securely from an eavesdropper, and thus communicate using a one-time pad like approach. The basic idea is to exploit new opportunities that wireless networks offer, such as the fact that we have multiple paths, the fact that we have packet losses, and the availability of ACK/NACK feedback.},

  Abstract                 = {In logic synthesis, the search space is infinite in the sense that any number of gates can be connected using any topology to come up with the best circuit under performance and other constraints. In formal verification, to achieve full coverage, an n-input circuit must be checked either explicitly or implicitly using the complete set of 2n input values. There are, however, situations when the possible circuit topologies are limited. Logic optimization methods, in general, do not change circuit topologies dramatically. Most of them are based on series of local circuit transformations. In this paper, we discuss formal verification of circuits produced by logic synthesis where the search space is limited, and only gates or subcircuits are transformed whereas their interconnections never change. If there are p possible transformations for each gate or subcircuit, and there are m gates or subcircuits in the entire circuit, the number of all possible transformations for the entire circuit is pm. Logic synthesis with this restriction attempts to find the best circuit among the pm alternatives. The logic synthesis problem can be formulated as a sequence of incremental SAT problems and the complete set of test patterns can be computed, which detects all possible errors in the synthesized circuit. As long as the search space is limited to the pm alternatives, such complete set of test patterns can be used for formal verification. The number of test patterns needed in this case is experimentally shown to be very small, e.g., a few hundred, even for circuits having several hundred inputs and several thousand gates. With the complete set of test patterns generated for the circuit transformations, logic synthesis and formal verification are unified in the sense that the small number of test patterns allows for logic synthesis with 100% correctness.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital beamforming (DBF) has long been heralded as the next frontier in phased array technology, and not without reason. The digitization of transmit and receive signals at the element level opens the door to new processing and beamforming schemes and promises to deliver maximum flexibility and unprecedented dynamic range in large systems. However, it is not without inherent technological risks and practical challenges associated with the amount of data to process and the use of less sophisticated transceivers. This paper provides broad overviews of several interrelated aspects of the resulting DBF trade spaces for these systems. In particular, emerging concepts are highlighted for the roles and interconnection of distributed beamforming/processing for fixed and adaptive beamforming. These are then related to digital array calibration mechanisms that can potentially reduce the need for data- and processing-intensive beamforming algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {Earth observation through remote sensing images allows the accurate characterization and identification of materials on the surface from space and airborne platforms. Multiple and heterogeneous image sources can be available for the same geographical region: multispectral, hyperspectral, radar, multitemporal, and multiangular images can today be acquired over a given scene. These sources can be combined/fused to improve classification of the materials on the surface. Even if this type of systems is generally accurate, the field is about to face new challenges: the upcoming constellations of satellite sensors will acquire large amounts of images of different spatial, spectral, angular, and temporal resolutions. In this scenario, multimodal image fusion stands out as the appropriate framework to address these problems. In this paper, we provide a taxonomical view of the field and review the current methodologies for multimodal classification of remote sensing images. We also highlight the most recent advances, which exploit synergies with machine learning and signal processing: sparse methods, kernel-based fusion, Markov modeling, and manifold alignment. Then, we illustrate the different approaches in seven challenging remote sensing applications: 1) multiresolution fusion for multispectral image classification; 2) image downscaling as a form of multitemporal image fusion and multidimensional interpolation among sensors of different spatial, spectral, and temporal resolutions; 3) multiangular image classification; 4) multisensor image fusion exploiting physically-based feature extractions; 5) multitemporal image classification of land covers in incomplete, inconsistent, and vague image sources; 6) spatiospectral multisensor fusion of optical and radar images for change detection; and 7) cross-sensor adaptation of classifiers. The adoption of these techniques in operational settings will help to monitor our planet from space in the very near future.},

Radar represents a fundamentally important use of the electromagnetic (EM) spectrum, in applications which include air traffic control, geophysical monitoring of Earth resources from space, automotive safety, severe weather tracking, and surveillance for defense and security. Nearly all services have a need for greater bandwidth, which means that there will be ever-greater competition for this finite resource. The paper explains the nature of the spectrum congestion problem from a radar perspective, and describes a number of possible approaches to its solution both from technical and regulatory points of view. These include improved transmitter spectral purity, passive radar, and intelligent, cognitive approaches that dynamically optimize spectrum use.},

  Abstract                 = {Inspired by the celebration of the year of light in 2015, this article considers the long lasting interaction among man, vision and light. Our knowledge of light has greatly evolved in time together with the development of our civilization, with a tremendous boost in the last two centuries thanks to the outstanding contributions of many scholars and scientists from so many different countries. This presentation has highlighted the main steps upon which the knowledge of light has emerged, tracing the great phases in the history of science. At the same time, the use we make of light has enormously changed from ancient times when we used it to light our dwellings at night, but this is another story out of the scope of this paper. From a certain point of view, we can say that our knowledge of light, broadening in time, has increasingly enlightened our understanding of the world we live in, and, after all, the comprehension of ourselves.},

  Abstract                 = {Printed and flexible electronic components have been used and proposed in a wide range of markets, including biomedical, environmental, computers, energy, and communication. Fully printed and flexible electronic systems promise great advantages in ease of manufacture, weight, durability, and physical conformity, but such systems have failed to achieve widespread adoption. Printed technology still seeks solutions in the areas of complex logic, analog circuitry, power usage, and light emission. First, the benefits and challenges of taking hybrid manufacturing approaches that combine printed components with either traditional integrated circuits or recently fabricated complex flexible devices are discussed. Second, a recently realized set of physically flexible integrated circuits poised to accelerate the development of flexible sensor systems is presented, enabling the combination of low cost and large format printed systems with high performance and low-power silicon-based semiconductors. The chip set addresses the three requirements of flexible sensor systems, namely, sensor readout, signal processing, and communications with three chips-an analog-to-digital converter, a microcontroller, and an RF communicator. This technology may revolutionize such things as smart, wearable consumer devices, flexible and conformal industrial applications, and smart structures for military, automotive, and aerospace.},

  Abstract                 = {Electric propulsion has emerged as one of the most efficient propulsion arrangements for several vessel types over the last decades. Even though examples can be found in the history at the end of 19th century, and further into the 20th century, the modern use of electric propulsion started in the 1980s along with the development of semiconductor switching devices to be used in high power drives (dc drives and later ac-to-ac drives). This development opened up for full rpm control of propellers and thrusters, and thereby enabling a simplification of the mechanical structure. However, the main reason for using electric propulsion in commercial ship applications is the potential for fuel savings compared to equivalent mechanical alternatives, except for icebreakers where the performance of an electric powered propeller is superior to a combustion engine powered propeller. The fuel saving potential lies within the fact that the applicable vessels have a highly varying operation profile and are seldom run at full power. This favors the power plant principle in which electric power can be produced at any time with optimum running of prime movers, e.g., diesel engines, by turning on and off units depending on the power demand for propulsion and other vessel loads. Icebreakers were among the first vessels to take advantage of this technology later followed by cruise vessel, and the offshore drilling vessels operating with dynamic positioning (DP). The converter technology was rapidly developing and soon the dc drives were replaced with ac drives. In the same period electric propulsion emerged as basic standard for large cruise liners, and DP operated drilling vessels, but also found its way into other segments as shuttle tankers, ferries, and other special vessels. At the same time podded propulsion were introduced, where the electric motor was mounted directly on the propeller shaft in a submerged 360 $^{circ}$ steerable pod, adding better efficiency, improved maneuverin- , and reduced installation space/cost to the benefits of electric propulsion. The future trends are now focusing on further optimization of efficiency by allowing multiple energy sources, independent operation of individual power producers, and energy storage for various applications, such as power back up, peak shaving, or emission free operation (short voyages).},

  Abstract                 = {Much has been published about potential benefits of the adoption of cyber-physical systems (CPSs) in manufacturing industry. However, less has been said about how such automation systems might be effectively configured and supported through their lifecycles and how application modeling, visualization, and reuse of such systems might be best achieved. It is vitally important to be able to incorporate support for engineering best practice while at the same time exploiting the potential that CPS has to offer in an automation systems setting. This paper considers the industrial context for the engineering of CPS. It reviews engineering approaches that have been proposed or adopted to date including Industry 4.0 and provides examples of engineering methods and tools that are currently available. The paper then focuses on the CPS engineering toolset being developed by the Automation Systems Group (ASG) in the Warwick Manufacturing Group (WMG), University of Warwick, Coventry, U.K. and explains via an industrial case study how such a component-based engineering toolset can support an integrated approach to the virtual and physical engineering of automation systems through their lifecycle via a method that enables multiple vendors' equipment to be effectively integrated and provides support for the specification, validation, and use of such systems across the supply chain, e.g., between end users and system integrators.},

In this report we highlight advances that are enabling such promising capabilities in technology-specifically, the fabrication of device elements using high performance inorganic electronic materials joined with printing and transfer methods to effect their integration within functional modules. We emphasize in this review considerations of the design strategies and assembly techniques that, when taken together, circumvent limitations imposed by approaches that integrate circuit elements within compact, rigid, and essentially planar form factor devices, and provide a transformational set of capabilities for high performance flexible/stretchable electronics.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern technology combined with the desire to minimize the size and weight of a ship's power system are leading to renewed interest in more electric or all-electric ships. An important characteristic of the emerging ship power system is an increasing level of load variability, with some future pulsed loads requiring peak power in excess of the available steady-state power. This inevitably leads to the need for some additional energy storage beyond that inherent in the fuel. With the current and evolving technology, it appears that storage will be in the form of batteries, rotating machines, and capacitors. All of these are in use on ships today and all have enjoyed significant technological improvements over the last decade. Moreover, all are expected to be further enhanced by today's materials research. A key benefit of storage is that, when it can be justified for a given load, it can have additional beneficial uses such as ride-through capability to restart a gas turbine if there is an unanticipated power loss; alternatively, storage can be used to stabilize the power grid when switching large loads. Knowing when to stage gas turbine utilization versus energy storage is a key subject in this article. The clear need for storage has raised the opportunity to design a comprehensive storage system, sometimes called an energy magazine, that can combine intermittent generation as well as any or all of the other storage technologies to provide a smaller, lighter and better performing system than would individual storage solutions for each potential application.},

Much of recent work has focused on understanding the computational complexity of proposed methods for Ã¢ÂÂBig Data.Ã¢ÂÂ Sample complexity, however, has received relatively less attention, especially in the setting when the sample size n is fixed, and the dimension p grows without bound. To address this gap, we develop a unified statistical framework that explicitly quantifies the sample complexity of various inferential tasks. Sampling regimes can be divided into several categories: 1) the classical asymptotic regime where the variable dimension is fixed and the sample size goes to infinity; 2) the mixed asymptotic regime where both variable dimension and sample size go to infinity at comparable rates; and 3) the purely high-dimensional asymptotic regime where the variable dimension goes to infinity and the sample size is fixed. Each regime has its niche but only the latter regime applies to exa-scale data dimension. We illustrate this high-dimensional framework for the problem of correlation mining, where it is the matrix of pairwise and partial correlations among the variables that are of interest. Correlation mining arises in numerous applications and subsumes the regression context as a special case. We demonstrate various regimes of correlation mining based on the unifying perspective of high-dimensional learning rates and sample complexity for different structured covariance models and different inferenc- tasks.},

  Abstract                 = {Blood pressure is a vital element to maintain circulation and eventually cellular respiration and metabolism. Blood pressure abnormalities are one of the most common diseases worldwide and their prevalence increases with age. For decades, basic and clinical investigations have shown that autonomic dysregulation/imbalance is involved in the development and progression of cardiovascular diseases. Arterial baroreflex is a powerful regulator of blood pressure and sympathetic nervous system. Closed-loop neuromodulation technology focusing on arterial baroreflex is challenging and might be promising to tackle the pathogenesis of blood pressure-related disorders, autonomic dysregulation, and eventually cardiovascular diseases. For more than a decade, we and associates have developed Ã¢ÂÂbionicÃ¢ÂÂ baroreflex systems. Ã¢ÂÂBionicÃ¢ÂÂ means that the device is designed to replicate the dynamic characteristics of the native system to fully restore the function. The bionic baroreflex system basically consists of an artificial pressure sensor, a neurostimulator for autonomic nerves and a regulator that encodes blood pressure into neurostimulation. In the process of development toward clinical applicability, researchers have faced logical problems in designing the controller and practical problems of how to approach baroreflex activation. Closed-loop baroreflex systems utilizing sympathetic nerve trunk stimulation, spinal cord stimulation and noninvasive transcutaneous stimulation were proposed. Recently, the bionic baroreceptor was reported and proposed to be a potential therapy for heart failure. In this article, we introduce the closed-loop neuromodulation technology for baroreflex blood pressure control and discuss future direction of development of this technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Several strategies are currently employed to enhance the detection limit of bead-based assays, but all these approaches improve the sensitivity by varying the assay procedures chemically or biologically. In previous digital microfluidic setups for bead-based immunoassay, the magnetic beads were suspended for detection. We investigated the effect of bead aggregation in such an immunoassay system and propose the aggregation magnified post-assay fluorescence for ultrasensitive immunodetection on digital microfluidics (AMPFLUID). The detection signal and sensitivity are further enhanced even at the post-assay stage without altering the original assay protocol on employing magnetically triggered post-assay aggregation of beads in a digital microfluidic setup followed by processing of the fluorescent signal. This method is shown to enhance the fluorescent signal with increased consistency and sensitivity after appropriate charge-coupled device (CCD) calibration. This method of on-chip detection allows the fulfilment of consumption of a volume at the nanoliter level and a limit of detection in the range picogram/mL. In our sTNF-RI model immunoassay, only 2.5 nL of sample is required; a detection limit 15 pg/mL is achieved. The decreased uncertainty of the measure is indicated by the error bars and coefficient of variation.},

  Abstract                 = {Manufacturing execution systems play an important role of bridging high-level enterprise functions and production or manufacturing operations. The embedded systems are usually in charge of controlling execution of the operations. Modern embedded systems have become capable of simultaneous and deterministic execution of control algorithms and IP-based communication, making it possible to create complex cyber-physical systems (CPSs), where the computational and communication resources of a device can be used directly for various control, supervisory, or monitoring functions. The complexity for defining open-knowledge-driven manufacturing execution system (OKD-MES) is in maintaining awareness of overall system state to avoid disruptive actions as various functions may be requested from a system. The problem is that obtaining such information on system state may necessitate collecting data from a number of devices, as there may not be a single data point for state information. This paper describes and illustrates an approach for designing OKD-MES on top of CPSs that controls robot workstations and conveyor-based transportation system of a pallet-based production system.},

As information and communication technologies continue to address the need for increased computational power through the increase of cores within a digital processor, neuromorphic engineers and scientists can complement this need by building processor architectures where memory is distributed with the processing. In this paper, we present a survey of brain-inspired processor architectures that support models of cortical networks and deep neural networks. These architectures range from serial clocked implementations of multineuron systems to massively parallel asynchronous ones and from purely digital systems to mixed analog/digital systems which implement more biological-like models of neurons and synapses together with a suite of adaptation and learning mechanisms analogous to the ones found in biological nervous systems. We describe the advantages of the different approaches being pursued and present the challenges that need to be addressed for building artificial neural processing systems that can display the richness of behaviors seen in biological systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Digital hardware accelerators are increasingly employed to speed up computation and reduce power dissipation, enabling real-time operation. Inspired by this paradigm, we propose the concept of the photonic hardware accelerator-an analog optical processing engine that precedes optical-to-electrical conversion and alleviates the burden on subsequent electronics. We propose one specific class of photonic hardware accelerators designed to assist in acquisition, feature extraction, and storage of wideband waveforms. This fundamental unit reshapes, in real time, the spectrotemporal evolution of a wideband streaming signal based on signal's sparsity. Functioning as an information gearbox, the accelerator transforms the signal according to the nonuniform entropy of its spectrum. Nonlinear group delay dispersion modes are introduced as primitive building blocks for such transformations. Representing spectrotemporal basis functions, these modes and their corresponding time-stretch wavelets have distinct and useful properties that depend on their symmetry. We focus on polynomial basis functions, but also discuss their limitations and alternatives such as spline functions that offer more efficient representation of group delay spectra with localized features. They are used to synthesize complex warped spectrotemporal operations that are reconfigurable and can be implemented in both analog optical and digital (computational) domains. We show how these dispersion-based computational primitives reshape the wideband signal to enable nonuniform sampling, compression, and pattern recognition in real time. Additional applications including coding, signal classification, and enhancement of signal-to-noise ratio during ultrafast analog-to-digital conversion are discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Clinical data management systems typically provide caregiver teams with useful information, derived from large, sometimes highly heterogeneous, data sources that are often changing dynamically. Over the last decade there has been a significant surge in interest in using these data sources, from simply reusing the standard clinical databases for event prediction or decision support, to including dynamic and patient-specific information into clinical monitoring and prediction problems. However, in most cases, commercial clinical databases have been designed to document clinical activity for reporting, liability, and billing reasons, rather than for developing new algorithms. With increasing excitement surrounding Ã¢ÂÂsecondary use of medical recordsÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂBig DataÃ¢ÂÂ analytics, it is important to understand the limitations of current databases and what needs to change in order to enter an era of Ã¢ÂÂprecision medicine.Ã¢ÂÂ This review article covers many of the issues involved in the collection and preprocessing of critical care data. The three challenges in critical care are considered: compartmentalization, corruption, and complexity. A range of applications addressing these issues are covered, including the modernization of static acuity scoring; online patient tracking; personalized prediction and risk assessment; artifact detection; state estimation; and incorporation of multimodal data sources such as genomic and free text data.},

We especially focus on scheduling smart building demand along with other possibly highly uncertain microgrid generation resources a day ahead or shorter ahead of operation. Since every building demand has different energy consumption profiles and dynamics, it is inefficient for the grid operator to directly control a potentially large number of buildings. On the other hand, if the grid operator does not have sufficient information on the buildings and their resource potentials, smart buildings cannot be deployed to the full extent. Our proposed framework attempts to align these conflicting objectives in a reasonable way, taking into consideration the realistic limitations of communication time, various physical characteristics and dynamics of the buildings, and the building managers' economic objectives. This framework is in line with the concept of dynamic monitoring and decision systems (DYMONDS), where the economic objectives and physical dynamics of any flexible generation and loads on the grid are aggregated by load aggregators and incorporated in the optimal system operation.},

  Abstract                 = {The wireless medium offers many opportunities for broadcast communications. However, it also opens the possibility for attackers to eavesdrop the broadcast data or to pretend to be another node or device. These two attacks define the protection goals, namely, confidentiality and authenticity. Traditionally, both are solved by cryptographic approaches exploiting knowledge available in the surrounding infrastructure. The novel communication paradigms for the Internet of Things or cyber-physical systems do not scale with the standard cryptographic approach. Instead it is possible to exploit properties of the underlying physical channel to provide countermeasures against eavesdropping and impersonation attacks. Thereby, the random fading channel induces uncertainty which is detrimental but at the same time also helpful. In this paper, we review and describe a generalized model for physical-layer-based confidential data transmission and wireless authentication. A key role is played by the channel uncertainty and available design dimensions such as time, frequency, and space. We show that wireless authentication and secret-key generation can work in multicarrier and multiple-antenna systems and explain how even outdated channel state information can help to increase the available secure degrees of freedom. This survey focuses on the system design of wireless physical-layer confidentiality and authenticity under channel uncertainty. The insights could lead to a design of practical systems which are preparing the ground for confidentiality and authenticity already on the physical layer of the communication protocol stack.},

  Abstract                 = {Patterning functional materials is one of the key technologies to enable flexible electronics. In almost every flexible electronic device, individual materials and layers need to be patterned. Moreover, the importance of patterning is probably second only to materials properties in fabricated flexible functional devices. Frequently, patterning is one of the limiting factors in device performance. Flexible electronics depends upon the ability to construct layers of materials having precisely defined architectures and relationships on flexible supports. These structures require the ability to either deposit (additive) or remove (subtractive) materials in a locally controlled fashion (patterning). There are many techniques that have been used to accomplish the patterning of materials on flexible supports. In general, these patterning techniques have either been derived or adapted from conventional electronics processing, from printing processes, or from a hybrid of both. The appropriate choice of patterning technique will depend upon many considerations, including feature size, area of coverage, throughput, registration, environment, position in the overall device structure, and material considerations. Many, if not most device structures will require the use of multiple different patterning techniques. The purpose of this paper is to review the major patterning techniques that have been used for flexible electronics, and to discuss the unique features, advantages, and disadvantages of each. The focus will be on large area, high throughput, additive deposition techniques that can be performed in ambient conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Current high-throughput data acquisition technologies probe dynamical systems with different imaging modalities, generating massive data sets at different spatial and temporal resolutions-posing challenging problems in multimodal data fusion. A case in point is the attempt to parse out the brain structures and networks that underpin human cognitive processes by analysis of different neuroimaging modalities (functional MRI, EEG, NIRS, etc.). We emphasize that the multimodal, multiscale nature of neuroimaging data is well reflected by a multiway (tensor) structure where the underlying processes can be summarized by a relatively small number of components or Ã¢ÂÂatoms.Ã¢ÂÂ We introduce Markov-Penrose diagrams-an integration of Bayesian DAG and tensor network notation in order to analyze these models. These diagrams not only clarify matrix and tensor EEG and fMRI time/frequency analysis and inverse problems, but also help understand multimodal fusion via multiway partial least squares and coupled matrix-tensor factorization. We show here, for the first time, that Granger causal analysis of brain networks is a tensor regression problem, thus allowing the atomic decomposition of brain networks. Analysis of EEG and fMRI recordings shows the potential of the methods and suggests their use in other scientific domains.},

One important issue in AV fusion is how the modalities interact and influence each other. This review will address this question in the context of AV speech processing, and especially speech recognition, where one of the issues is that the modalities both interact but also sometimes appear to desynchronize from each other. An additional issue that sometimes arises is that one of the modalities may be missing at test time, although it is available at training time; for example, it may be possible to collect AV training data while only having access to audio at test time. We will review approaches to address this issue from the area of multiview learning, where the goal is to learn a model or representation for each of the modalities separately while taking advantage of the rich multimodal training data. In addition to multiview learning, we also discuss the recent application of deep learning (DL) toward AV fusion.

In particular, all spin logic (ASL) technology, which performs Boolean operations and transfers the output in the spin domain, has been proposed for enabling new capabilities-such as high density, low device count, and nonvolatility-that were previously impossible with CMOS technology. In this paper, first we provide an overview of the history and the current status of the various spintronic devices being pursued by the research community. Then, we describe how spin-based components are integrated into a computing system and the advantages that result. We use a hypothetical spintronic-based Intel Core i7 as a test vehicle to compare the system-level power requirements of ASL- and CMOS-based systems, taking into consideration the unique demands of spin-based interconnects.

  Abstract                 = {Commercial buildings increasingly include technologies capable of providing ancillary services to electric power grids. Features include thermal energy storage inherent in building structures that can be coupled to electric grids through heating, ventilating, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems controlled by variable-speed drives (VSDs). In parking garages, plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs) are connected to the building power lines through charging stations and can be utilized as grid storage. System power electronics can control equipment power demand at frequencies associated with ancillary services procured in electricity markets, where services dispatch over time scales ranging from hours to seconds. Limitations in provision of services by buildings include building-scale thermal and electrical energy storage capacities: thermal comfort of occupants, state of charge of PEV batteries, and the power rating of VSDs and PEV chargers. This paper reviews available technologies and necessary control strategies for HVAC systems in commercial buildings to provide ancillary services. We then develop physically-based scaling metrics for building thermal storage technologies accessible through HVAC systems. In addition, the effect of ancillary services provided by HVAC systems on grid network and electricity market operations is analyzed using simulation case studies, incorporating magnitude scaling of services. We finally evaluate a possibility that the HVAC systems and PEVs provide three-phase voltage and power balance regulation services, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Electric propulsion of ships has experienced steady expansion for several decades. Since the early 20th century, icebreakers have employed the flexibility and easy control of direct current (dc) motors to provide for ship operations that split ice with back and forth motion of the ship. More recently, cruise ships have employed diesel-electric propulsion systems to take advantage of the flexibility of diesel, as opposed to steam engines, and because the electric plant can also be used for hotel loads. Research vessels, ferries, tankers, and special purpose vessels have also taken advantage of increased flexibility and fuel efficiency with electric propulsion. Today, the U.S. Navy is building an Ã¢ÂÂall electricÃ¢ÂÂ destroyer to be named Ã¢ÂÂZumwalt,Ã¢ÂÂ which employs two induction motors for propulsion. There are several different classes of motors that might be considered for use in ship propulsion, ranging from dc (commutator) motors through conventional induction and synchronous motors to permanent magnet synchronous machines, doubly fed machines and superconducting alternating current (ac) and acyclic homopolar machines. This review paper describes features of some of the major classes of motor that might be used in ship propulsion.},

  Abstract                 = {Over three decades ago an algebraic factoring algorithm was created as part of active logic synthesis efforts in the semiconductor industry. It initiated logic synthesis successes and steered synthesis in the direction of practical design tools: they can now take a design from its initial state to the final chip that meets a complex set of constraints. The evolved computing platforms today stimulate new exploratory avenues to extend the functionality of fundamental synthesis algorithms. We reexamine logic factoring in an effort to establish a stronger connection to the functional intent rather than structural implications of a design description within synthesis. A scalable factoring algorithm that reduces its dependence on the two-level minimization is described to improve the area of synthesized circuits. It is implemented using a new distributed environment that harnesses the key-value concept to find solutions through systematic transformations of a data set.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet has led to the creation of a digital society, where (almost) everything is connected and is accessible from anywhere. However, despite their widespread adoption, traditional IP networks are complex and very hard to manage. It is both difficult to configure the network according to predefined policies, and to reconfigure it to respond to faults, load, and changes. To make matters even more difficult, current networks are also vertically integrated: the control and data planes are bundled together. Software-defined networking (SDN) is an emerging paradigm that promises to change this state of affairs, by breaking vertical integration, separating the network's control logic from the underlying routers and switches, promoting (logical) centralization of network control, and introducing the ability to program the network. The separation of concerns, introduced between the definition of network policies, their implementation in switching hardware, and the forwarding of traffic, is key to the desired flexibility: by breaking the network control problem into tractable pieces, SDN makes it easier to create and introduce new abstractions in networking, simplifying network management and facilitating network evolution. In this paper, we present a comprehensive survey on SDN. We start by introducing the motivation for SDN, explain its main concepts and how it differs from traditional networking, its roots, and the standardization activities regarding this novel paradigm. Next, we present the key building blocks of an SDN infrastructure using a bottom-up, layered approach. We provide an in-depth analysis of the hardware infrastructure, southbound and northbound application programming interfaces (APIs), network virtualization layers, network operating systems (SDN controllers), network programming languages, and network applications. We also look at cross-layer problems such as debugging and troubleshooting. In an effort to anticipate the future evolution of this - ew paradigm, we discuss the main ongoing research efforts and challenges of SDN. In particular, we address the design of switches and control platforms - with a focus on aspects such as resiliency, scalability, performance, security, and dependability - as well as new opportunities for carrier transport networks and cloud providers. Last but not least, we analyze the position of SDN as a key enabler of a software-defined environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Over the past decade, we have witnessed the maturation of silicon-based phased array technology, which has started to make an impact on commercial and military wireless applications. Over the next decade, driven by the development of next-generation wireless communication networks, we will see the maturation and impact of large-scale multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) technology. MIMO receiver arrays exploit digital array signal processing, and consequently are exposed to interference in the analog and radio-frequency (RF) front ends. The absence of analog/RF interference mitigation in traditional digital MIMO receiver arrays results in designs with high-dynamic-range and power-hungry analog and RF receiver front ends and analog-to-digital converters. This paper describes recently developed techniques for spatio-spectral interference mitigation in the analog and RF domain for digital MIMO receivers. The techniques proposed are flexible; tunable across operating frequency; scalable; present low cost, size, and power consumption overheads; and are experimentally validated through a 0.1-1.7-GHz four-element receiver front-end array integrated circuit (IC) prototype in 65-nm complementary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) technology.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive robots, able to adapt their actions based on sensory information and the management of uncertainty, have begun to find their way into manufacturing settings. However, the full potential of these robots has not been fully exploited, largely due to the lack of vertical integration with existing IT infrastructures, such as the manufacturing execution system (MES), as part of a large-scale cyber-physical entity. This paper reports on considerations and findings from the research project STAMINA that is developing such a cognitive cyber-physical system and applying it to a concrete and well-known use case from the automotive industry. Our approach allows manufacturing tasks to be performed without human intervention, even if the available description of the environment-the world model-suffers from large uncertainties. Thus, the robot becomes an integral part of the MES, resulting in a highly flexible overall system.},

  Abstract                 = {In various disciplines, information about the same phenomenon can be acquired from different types of detectors, at different conditions, in multiple experiments or subjects, among others. We use the term Ã¢ÂÂmodalityÃ¢ÂÂ for each such acquisition framework. Due to the rich characteristics of natural phenomena, it is rare that a single modality provides complete knowledge of the phenomenon of interest. The increasing availability of several modalities reporting on the same system introduces new degrees of freedom, which raise questions beyond those related to exploiting each modality separately. As we argue, many of these questions, or Ã¢ÂÂchallenges,Ã¢ÂÂ are common to multiple domains. This paper deals with two key issues: Ã¢ÂÂwhy we need data fusionÃ¢ÂÂ and Ã¢ÂÂhow we perform it.Ã¢ÂÂ The first issue is motivated by numerous examples in science and technology, followed by a mathematical framework that showcases some of the benefits that data fusion provides. In order to address the second issue, Ã¢ÂÂdiversityÃ¢ÂÂ is introduced as a key concept, and a number of data-driven solutions based on matrix and tensor decompositions are discussed, emphasizing how they account for diversity across the data sets. The aim of this paper is to provide the reader, regardless of his or her community of origin, with a taste of the vastness of the field, the prospects, and the opportunities that it holds.},

  Abstract                 = {Amorphous oxide semiconductor thin film transistors and sensors constitute fundamental building blocks for a new generation of applications ranging from interactive displays and imaging to future electronic systems that are unconstrained by form factor. This makes the quest for high mobility materials processed at low temperatures even more compelling, to enable the layering of circuits and systems on plastic and possibly even paper substrates. Transparency is also an attractive feature that enables seamless embedding of electronics for the immersive ambient. This paper reviews the current status of the ubiquitous oxide semiconductor technology for flexible and transparent interactive displays, along with demonstrated examples of continuous thin film and nanowire systems for the transistor and sensor. Issues related to photo-sensing and active matrix operation are discussed along with solutions addressing the problem of threshold voltage instability and its compensation for fast recovery, particularly after light stress. Physics-based compact models for expedient design and simulation of analog and digital circuits are reviewed along with examples of key system building blocks. Finally we attempt to conceptualize a thin film transistor (TFT)-based fully heterogeneously integrated and autonomous system that can be realized using a combination of oxide and other technological routes.},

  Abstract                 = {Established classes of high-performance electronics have driven advances in interventional biomedicine. However, the large size, planar geometry and stiff mechanical properties of standard conventional electronics employed in medical devices give rise to important integration challenges with soft biological tissue. Stretchable and flexible biointegrated electronics could improve treatment procedures across a broad range of applications, including cardiac, neural and endovascular therapies. Here we present novel mechanics, materials and integration strategies for this new class of bioelectronics onboard minimally invasive catheter based systems. Co-located arrays of sensors and actuators affixed to cardiac and angioplasty balloon catheters capture new sensory information during ablation procedures, offering physicians the ability to adjust placement and treatment intra-procedurally. New circuit topologies, enabled by stretchable electronics, also overcome long standing challenges associated with transmitting vast amounts of data through narrow catheter lumens, thus allowing for a large number of sensors to be multiplexed for mapping electrophysiological activity with high spatiotemporal resolution and with a minimal number of routing wires. We present representative examples that highlight the clinical significance of soft bio-integrated electronics, along with the mechanics and processes that enable this technology.},

While the detailed neural mechanisms of Bayesian inference are not fully understood, recent computational and neurophysiological works have illuminated the underlying computational principles and representational architecture. The fundamental insights are that the visual system is organized as a modular hierarchy to encode an internal model of the world, and that perception is realized by statistical inference based on such internal model. In this paper, we will discuss and analyze the varieties of representational schemes of these internal models and how they might be used to perform learning and inference. We will argue for a unified theoretical framework for relating the internal models to the observed neural phenomena and mechanisms in the visual cortex.},

Furthermore, we demonstrate how the concept of shared control-which interprets the user's commands in context-empowers users to perform rather complex tasks without a high workload. We present the results of nine end-users with motor disabilities who were able to complete navigation tasks with a telepresence robot successfully in a remote environment (in some cases in a different country) that they had never previously visited. Moreover, these end-users achieved similar levels of performance to a control group of 10 healthy users who were already familiar with the environment.},

  Abstract                 = {In science and engineering mathematical modeling serves as a tool for the understanding of processes and systems and as a testing bed for several hypotheses, e.g., concerning the testing (prediction) of functional limits by simulations. A brief overview of current modeling strategies in brain research is given, spatial scales ranging from single neuron to large scale activity of and between brain regions are considered. The models are mainly time-invariant. Three time-variant modeling strategies, which enable a model-based signal analysis, are described and applied to large scale signals. The first is derived from adaptive filter theory and covers linear system and linear as well as nonlinear process models. The second is based on modeled brain source signals, i.e., the inverse problem must be solved. The third strategy consists of a generalization of Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM); DCM is frequently used for analysis of directed interactions between brain structures. Examples are derived from neonatal electroencephalography (EEG) monitoring of preterm and fullterm newborns. A further example is based on high-density recordings of event-related potentials (ERPs) and shows the combination of a time-variant ERP-based source model, as a part of a realistic head model, with a multivariate process model to analyze the time evolution of interactions between source processes before and during the execution of a complex motoric task. In two other examples hemodynamic signals (functional magnetic resonance imaging-fMRI) are utilized for analysis of interactions between brain regions, where nonlinear, multivariate models are used.},

Other circuit concepts are described, including a voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO) with a tuning range of 26 GHz and a high-performance (80 Gb/s) crossbar switch, which provide utility in reconfigurable system applications.

Here we focus on how machine learning can help to model the relationship between DNA and the quantities of key molecules in the cell, with the premise that these quantities, which we refer to as cell variables, may be associated with disease risks. Modern biology allows high-throughput measurement of many such cell variables, including gene expression, splicing, and proteins binding to nucleic acids, which can all be treated as training targets for predictive models.

First, the MFSS is designed using the square patches and the grid lines array to determine the operational frequency and bandwidth, and then the corners of the square patches are truncated to produce the phase difference of 90ÃÂ° between the two orthogonal linear components for circular polarization performance. To analyze and synthesize the PRC array, the operational mechanism is described in detail. The relation of the polarization states as a function of the rotating angle of the PRC array is summarized from the principle of operation. Therefore, the results show that the linear polarization (LP) from an incident wave can be reconfigured to LP, right- and left-hand circular polarizations by rotating the free-standing converter screen. The cell periods along x- and y-directions are the same, and their total height is 6 mm. The fractional bandwidth of axial ratio (AR) less than 3 dB is more than 15% with respect to the center operating frequency of 10 GHz at normal incidence. Simultaneously, the AR characteristics of different incidence angles for oblique incidence with TE and TM polarizations show that the proposed PRC has good polarization and angle stabilities. Moreover, the general design procedure and method is presented. Finally, a circularly shaped PRC array using the proposed PRC element based on the MFSS design is fabricated and measured. The agreement between the simulated and measured results is excellent.},

  Abstract                 = {Despite rapid advances in the study of brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) in recent decades, two fundamental challenges, namely, improvement of target detection performance and multidimensional control, continue to be major barriers for further development and applications. In this paper, we review the recent progress in multimodal BCIs (also called hybrid BCIs), which may provide potential solutions for addressing these challenges. In particular, improved target detection can be achieved by developing multimodal BCIs that utilize multiple brain patterns, multimodal signals, or multisensory stimuli. Furthermore, multidimensional object control can be accomplished by generating multiple control signals from different brain patterns or signal modalities. Here, we highlight several representative multimodal BCI systems by analyzing their paradigm designs, detection/control methods, and experimental results. To demonstrate their practicality, we report several initial clinical applications of these multimodal BCI systems, including awareness evaluation/detection in patients with disorder of consciousness (DOC). As an evolving research area, the study of multimodal BCIs is increasingly requiring more synergetic efforts from multiple disciplines for the exploration of the underlying brain mechanisms, the design of new effective paradigms and means of neurofeedback, and the expansion of the clinical applications of these systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern smart grid, as a typical cyber-physical system (CPS), allows plug-in hybrid electric vehicles (PHEVs) to be a promising candidate for grid services. In this paper, by following the CPS design approach, we propose a novel framework for the local aggregator to estimate the charging status and solve for the charging control signals for PHEVs. The physical battery charging is executed by charging stalls, where charging information is processed in the embedded system and only the generated index information is transmitted to the aggregator via Internet. An aggregation model is developed for the entire cyberspace to inherently guarantee heterogeneous charging requirements, i.e., deadlines for charging. Furthermore, we develop a nonlinear model-predictive control (NMPC) scheme for the overnight valley-filling service. Both the aggregation model and control strategy are designed based on the PHEV population migration probabilities. From the CPS perspective, both the cyber and physical loads of this novel framework are extremely low. As part of this paper, we present a case study to verify the proposed approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the major limitations of brain-computer interfaces (BCI) is their long calibration time, which limits their use in practice, both by patients and healthy users alike. Such long calibration times are due to the large between-user variability and thus to the need to collect numerous training electroencephalography (EEG) trials for the machine learning algorithms used in BCI design. In this paper, we first survey existing approaches to reduce or suppress calibration time, these approaches being notably based on regularization, user-to-user transfer, semi-supervised learning and a priori physiological information. We then propose new tools to reduce BCI calibration time. In particular, we propose to generate artificial EEG trials from the few EEG trials initially available, in order to augment the training set size. These artificial EEG trials are obtained by relevant combinations and distortions of the original trials available. We propose three different methods to do so. We also propose a new, fast and simple approach to perform user-to-user transfer for BCI. Finally, we study and compare offline different approaches, both old and new ones, on the data of 50 users from three different BCI data sets. This enables us to identify guidelines about how to reduce or suppress calibration time for BCI.},

  Abstract                 = {In their early days, brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) were only considered as control channel for end users with severe motor impairments such as people in the locked-in state. But, thanks to the multidisciplinary progress achieved over the last decade, the range of BCI applications has been substantially enlarged. Indeed, today BCI technology cannot only translate brain signals directly into control signals, but also can combine such kind of artificial output with a natural muscle-based output. Thus, the integration of multiple biological signals for real-time interaction holds the promise to enhance a much larger population than originally thought end users with preserved residual functions who could benefit from new generations of assistive technologies. A BCI system that combines a BCI with other physiological or technical signals is known as hybrid BCI (hBCI). In this work, we review the work of a large scale integrated project funded by the European commission which was dedicated to develop practical hybrid BCIs and introduce them in various fields of applications. This article presents an hBCI framework, which was used in studies with nonimpaired as well as end users with motor impairments.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present the evolution of software-defined radio (SDR) technology and show how it is currently at the forefront of numerous advances within the wireless sector, enabling new applications considered unrealizable only a decade ago. Specifically, this paper focuses on SDR from a discrete-time sampling perspective and discusses the efforts that are currently being pursued in order to further bridge the gap between these discrete-time samples, the hardware used to generate this information from continuous-time over-the-air signaling waveforms, and the software and digital logic used to process these samples into digital data via baseband processing. Given the extensive deployment of SDR technology across a growing number of applications, such as national defense, public safety, connected vehicles, education, and scientific research and development activities, it is vitally important that the wireless community understands the features, advantages, and limitations of this technology. With its versatility, cost, and functionality continuously improving, SDR has become a viable solution for prototyping wireless transceivers and networks that are much more tailored to specific applications and performance requirements relative to available off-the-shelf wireless solutions. To highlight the advantages and current issues with SDR technology, this paper presents several examples using a recently released, commercially available SDR platform.},

  Abstract                 = {If truly thin embedded and human worn flexible electronics are to become a commercial reality for wearable electronics, medical devices, and internet of things tags, effective energy storage technologies that safely and robustly match the mechanical flexibility of the overall system form factor are required. At the same time, the energy and transient power needs of functions such as wireless connectivity, information display, and high sample rate sensing must be supported. These capabilities have time-dependent power and current requirements often not captured in simple energy and capacity metrics. In this paper, a progression of energy storage approaches, challenges and learning experiences will be presented from the perspective of an energy storage technology developer. The essential requirements for energy storage for feature-driven applications in flexible electronics are addressed with the goal of finding the most compelling fit between products needs, consumer safety and the technology capabilities of different energy storage approaches. Micropower modules from supercapacitors to microbatteries and their limitations for flexible electronics will be discussed in terms of capacity, power and charge retention as the starting point. Following this discussion, limitations of lithium technologies in this flexible and thin (<; 1 mm) application space are also outlined. This paper then presents a review of key requirements for energy storage for high functionality flexible electronics prototype systems and some approaches that have been explored to meet those needs. This leads to the conclusion that safe, low cost, flexible electronics energy storage requirements may be most appropriately met using intrinsically stable battery chemistry. Furthermore, such a materials approach allows for simpler lower cost processing and packaging, such as additive printing and roll to roll processing of thin and therefore more mechanically flexible cells. Examples and performance- data from such a zinc polymer battery technology are given and compared to other thin and flexible battery approaches.},

This can be accomplished by recognizing that computational processes can be used to assemble and reconfigure complex, hierarchically structured systems. Programmable matter may be programmatically controlled externally or internally, which includes self-assembly. The best approach to the self-assembly of complex, hierarchical systems, such as future robots with capabilities comparable to those of animals, is by artificial morphogenesis, which adapts embryological morphogenesis to artificial systems.

  Abstract                 = {We start from a few examples of coupled behavioral sciences data, along with associated research questions and data-analytic methods. Linking up with these, we introduce a few concepts and distinctions, by means of which we specify the focus of this paper: 1) data that take the form of a collection of coupled matrices that are linked in either the experimental unit or the variable data mode; 2) associated with questions about the mechanisms underlying these data matrices; 3) which are to be addressed by data-analytic methods that rely on a submodel per data matrix, with a common parameterization of the shared data mode. Next, we outline the principles of two closely related families within this focus: the families of multiblock component- and factor-based models for data fusion (while considering both deterministic and stochastic model variants). Then, we review developments within these families to capture both similarities and differences between the different data matrices under study. We follow with a discussion on recent attempts to address quite a few challenges in data fusion based on multiblock component and factor models, including whether and how to differentially weigh the different data matrices under study, and problems such as dealing with large numbers of variables, outliers, and missing values. While the focus of this paper is on data and modeling contributions from the behavioral sciences, we point in a concluding section at their relevance for other domains and at the importance of related methods developed in those domains.},

Lab-on-chips (LoCs) have undergone a great growth in this direction, supported by optical imaging techniques more and more refined. Here we present recent progresses in developing imaging tools based on coherent imaging microscopy that can be very useful when applied into biomicrofluidics. In some cases, the optical tweezers (OT) technique is combined with digital holography (DH), thus offering the possibility to manipulate, analyze, and measure fundamental parameters of different kinds of cells. This approach can open the route for rapid and high-throughput analysis in label-free microfluidic devices and for prognostic based on cell examination, thus allowing advancements in biomedical science.},

  Abstract                 = {The complex process of improving the energy efficiency of a building begins with understanding baseline conditions and assessing the potential for specific improvements. Traditional benchmarking typically addresses the status quo, e.g., by comparing the building to its peers at one point in time or longitudinally. Action-oriented benchmarking extends this process by also inferring potential energy-efficiency opportunities. Doing so, however, requires more in-depth benchmarking than offered by traditional Ã¢ÂÂwhole-buildingÃ¢ÂÂ assessment methods. The process begins by carefully identifying a peer group for comparison that has true relevance to the subject building, and then disaggregating energy use by fuels and end uses to better pinpoint inefficiencies. Toward this end, the benchmarking process can be extended from energy to emissions and costs. Building characteristics and energy utilization parameters, as distinct from resource utilization data, can also be benchmarked in order to ascertain potential relevance and applicability of energy-efficient technologies or practices. To ensure savings attainment and persistence, benchmarking must continue throughout a building's lifecycle. A publicly funded web-based benchmarking system called EnergyIQ is introduced, which implements the aforementioned principals.},

They have been shown to dominate the near-field of several open wave-guiding structures, of great interest to tailor their radiation, guidance and filtering properties. The elegant theoretical analyses and deep physical insights in this area, developed in an era in which computational resources were limited, represent a fundamental scientific legacy that is still extremely relevant in today's engineering society and beyond. In this regard, the relevance of leaky-wave concepts has been increasingly recognized in recent times over a broader scientific community, including optics and physics societies. In this paper, after revisiting the fundamental concepts of leaky-wave theory, we discuss and connect different relevant research activities in which leaky-wave concepts have been applied, with the goal of facilitating multidisciplinary interactions on these topics. In addition to the canonical microwave applications of leaky waves, particular attention is devoted to a few areas of interest in modern optics, such as directive optical antennas, extraordinary optical transmission, and embedded scattering eigenvalues, in which leaky waves play a fundamental role.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet of Things (IoT) will feature pervasive sensing and control capabilities via a massive deployment of machine-type communication (MTC) devices. The limited hardware, low-complexity, and severe energy constraints of MTC devices present unique communication and security challenges. As a result, robust physical-layer security methods that can supplement or even replace lightweight cryptographic protocols are appealing solutions. In this paper, we present an overview of low-complexity physical-layer security schemes that are suitable for the IoT. A local IoT deployment is modeled as a composition of multiple sensor and data subnetworks, with uplink communications from sensors to controllers, and downlink communications from controllers to actuators. The state of the art in physical-layer security for sensor networks is reviewed, followed by an overview of communication network security techniques. We then pinpoint the most energy-efficient and low-complexity security techniques that are best suited for IoT sensing applications. This is followed by a discussion of candidate low-complexity schemes for communication security, such as on-off switching and space-time block codes. The paper concludes by discussing open research issues and avenues for further work, especially the need for a theoretically well-founded and holistic approach for incorporating complexity constraints in physical-layer security designs.},

  Abstract                 = {Remote sensing is one of the most common ways to extract relevant information about Earth and our environment. Remote sensing acquisitions can be done by both active (synthetic aperture radar, LiDAR) and passive (optical and thermal range, multispectral and hyperspectral) devices. According to the sensor, a variety of information about the Earth's surface can be obtained. The data acquired by these sensors can provide information about the structure (optical, synthetic aperture radar), elevation (LiDAR), and material content (multispectral and hyperspectral) of the objects in the image. Once considered together their complementarity can be helpful for characterizing land use (urban analysis, precision agriculture), damage detection (e.g., in natural disasters such as floods, hurricanes, earthquakes, oil spills in seas), and give insights to potential exploitation of resources (oil fields, minerals). In addition, repeated acquisitions of a scene at different times allows one to monitor natural resources and environmental variables (vegetation phenology, snow cover), anthropological effects (urban sprawl, deforestation), climate changes (desertification, coastal erosion), among others. In this paper, we sketch the current opportunities and challenges related to the exploitation of multimodal data for Earth observation. This is done by leveraging the outcomes of the data fusion contests, organized by the IEEE Geoscience and Remote Sensing Society since 2006. We will report on the outcomes of these contests, presenting the multimodal sets of data made available to the community each year, the targeted applications, and an analysis of the submitted methods and results: How was multimodality considered and integrated in the processing chain? What were the improvements/new opportunities offered by the fusion? What were the objectives to be addressed and the reported solutions? And from this, what will be the next challenges?},

  Abstract                 = {This paper reviews an approach to secret-key distribution based on the bounded observability (BO) model. First, the information-theoretic framework of secret-key agreement from a correlated random source is reviewed. Next, the BO model is introduced. In the context of this model, the BO condition is presented as a necessary and sufficient condition for the possibility of secret-key distribution. This condition describes limits on the information obtained by observation of a random object, and models the practical difficulty of completely observing random physical phenomena. Finally, an implementation of secret-key distribution based on BO in an optical fiber system is described.},

  Abstract                 = {In modern design flows, technology-dependent logic optimizations consist of technology mapping and transformations applied after mapping. Advances have been made in technology mapping in the last decade. However, it is inherently an intractable problem and state-of-the-art algorithms produce suboptimal netlists in terms of area and timing. Also, during the design flow, when physical information becomes available, wire loads and net delays change the timing values at the gates. That presents opportunities for further timing and area optimization. This is accomplished by transforms such as gate sizing, gate replication, buffer optimization, restructuring and remapping, and pin permutation. In this paper, we survey algorithms for technology-dependent optimizations, along with a comparison of their relative power to optimize the netlist.},

As technology has made possible significantly larger and faster machines with multiple processors, the relative distance in processor cycles of this memory has increased considerably. Microarchitectural techniques have evolved to share this memory across ever-larger systems of processors with deep cache hierarchies and have managed to hide this latency for many applications, but are proving to be expensive and energy-inefficient for newer types of problems working on massive amounts of data. New paradigms include scale-out systems distributed across hundreds and even thousands of nodes, in-memory databases that keep data in memory much longer than the duration of a single task, and near-data computation, where some of the computation is off-loaded to the location of the data to avoid wasting energy in the movement of data. This paper provides a historical perspective on the evolution of memory architecture, and suggests that the requirements of new problems and new applications are likely to fundamentally change processor and system architecture away from the currently established von Neumann model.},

To link ILD to clinical applications, such as personalized healthcare and disease prevention, the development of robust and reliable data analysis techniques is considered important. In this review, we introduce multiscale analysis methods for and the applications to two types of intensive longitudinal biomedical signals, heart rate variability (HRV) and spontaneous physical activity (SPA) time series. It has been shown that these ILD have robust characteristics unique to various multiscale complex systems, and some parameters characterizing the multiscale complexity are in fact altered in pathological states, showing potential usability as a new type of ambient diagnostic and/or prognostic tools. For example, parameters characterizing increased intermittency of HRV are found to be potentially useful in detecting abnormality in the state of the autonomic nervous system, in particular the sympathetic hyperactivity, and intermittency parameters of SPA might also be useful in evaluating symptoms of psychiatric patients with depressive as well as manic episodes, all in the daily settings. Therefore, multiscale analysis might be a useful tool to extract information on clinical events occurring at multiple time scales during daily life and the underlying physiological control mechanisms from biomedical ILD.},

In particular, we discuss two fundamentally different kinds of statistical relational models, both of which can scale to massive data sets. The first is based on latent feature models such as tensor factorization and multiway neural networks. The second is based on mining observable patterns in the graph. We also show how to combine these latent and observable models to get improved modeling power at decreased computational cost. Finally, we discuss how such statistical models of graphs can be combined with text-based information extraction methods for automatically constructing knowledge graphs from the Web. To this end, we also discuss Google's knowledge vault project as an example of such combination.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper addresses the key issues that must be overcome to realize fully printed TFT-based flexible devices via commercially viable methods. In particular the threshold voltage (Vth) variation in printed TFTs is a serious impediment to the successful launch of fully printed TFT-based devices in the market. The underlying causes of the Vth variation in fully printed TFTs were analyzed by considering the misalignment of printed drain-source to gate electrodes, the rheology of electronic inks and effects from external sources of charge. By alleviating the influences of external sources of charge using a printed passivation layer, Vth variation is maintained below 30% using a fully printed process. Based on the attainable variation range, the required number of integrated TFTs was estimated to fabricate a fully printed TFT-based radio frequency (RF) sensor device. A practical compromise enables fully printed RF sensors to be realized via the scalability of printing processes that mitigate Vth variation by minimizing the level of TFT integration. Prototypes of fully printed RF sensors with human interactive capability-an RF sensor label, and an RF e-sensor (cyclic voltammetry) tag-are enabled with as few as 26 printed TFTs, demonstrating that low-cost and high throughput manufacturing of printed electronics is feasible.},

  Abstract                 = {A wiretap channel is a communication channel between a transmitter Alice and a legitimate receiver Bob, in the presence of an eavesdropper Eve. The goal of communication is to achieve reliability between Alice and Bob, but also confidentiality despite Eve's presence. Wiretap channels are declined in all kinds of flavors, depending on the underlying channels used by the three players: discrete memoryless channels, additive Gaussian noise channels, or fading channels, to name a few. In this survey, we focus on the case where the three players use multiple-antenna channels with Gaussian noise to communicate. After summarizing known results for multiple-input-multiple-output (MIMO) channels, both in terms of achievable reliable data rate (capacity) and code design, we introduce the MIMO wiretap channel. We then state the MIMO wiretap capacity, summarize the idea of the proof(s) behind this result, and comment on the insights given by the proofs on the physical meaning of the secrecy capacity. We finally discuss design criteria for MIMO wiretap codes.},

  Abstract                 = {The introduction of electromagnetic (EM) media with unique field manipulation properties, collectively labelled as metamaterials, has boosted the interest toward the design, the fabrication, and the testing of artificial materials whose features can be engineered according to the applicative requirements and user objectives. In this framework, the long-term promise of reconfigurable metamaterial theory (i.e., the possibility to change the EM response of a 2-D/3-D material arbitrarily and in real time) has given the designers an extremely wide number of new degrees of freedom for the synthesis of innovative adaptive systems. Moreover, successful experimental validations of reconfigurable metamaterials in the entire EM spectrum from microwaves to optical frequencies have further stimulated academic and industrial interests in developing devices with enhanced performances, efficiency, and robustness. Nevertheless, the exploitation of reconfigurable metamaterials in commercial devices is still an open problem with several challenges from both the theoretical and technological viewpoints. This paper is then aimed at reviewing the latest advances on reconfigurable metamaterial engineering from the methodological perspective also providing a comprehensive and balanced survey on latest concepts, current trends, and envisaged future developments on this active field of research.},

  Abstract                 = {Maternal and infant health is a global healthcare problem affecting developing and developed countries alike. Pregnancy complications increase the risk of maternal and infant death, and are associated with adverse outcomes such as miscarriage, stillbirth, and preterm birth. Lifestyle modifications before and during pregnancy have been shown to reduce the risk of pregnancy complications. This paper evaluates the use of wearable sensors as an enabling technology to motivate healthier lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy. Wearable sensors have been used to track health and lifestyle in general populations. Pregnancy is associated with hormonal, physiological and psychological adaptations that need to be taken into account when quantifying lifestyle, and there is to date no solution available to accurately measure lifestyle behaviors during pregnancy. The main challenges lay in developing algorithms and systems capable of dealing with physiological adaptations, lifestyle adaptations, and enabling longitudinal monitoring throughout pregnancy. Addressing these challenges will open new opportunities towards an integrated and personalized approach to behavior change interventions based on sensor data. Putting such solutions in the hands of consumers will unlock a crowdsourcing approach to quantifying known risk factors, discovering new markers for pregnancy complications, and to answering some of the fundamental questions that remain around adverse outcomes such as preterm birth.},

A central question is: how to empower users to understand, monitor, and control the automated processes of Industrie 4.0? Addressing these design challenges requires a full integration of user-centered design (UCD) processes into the development process.

This tutorial reviews predictability improvement, information-based and frequency domain methods for inferring WGC among physiological processes from multivariate realizations and quantifying the strength of the cause-effect relations in network physiology. Studies relevant to cardiovascular control and neuroscience are listed as examples of applications in prominent biomedical fields in which WGC analysis led to remarkable advancements in our knowledge.

The focus of the paper is the energy- and cost-efficient realization of these arrays in order to enable new applications. Distributed algorithms for beamforming are proposed, and the optimum array size is considered as a function of the performance of the receiver, transmitter, frequency synthesizer, and signal distribution within the array. The effects of errors such as phase noise and synchronization skew across the array are analyzed. The paper discusses both RF frequencies below 10 GHz, where fully digital techniques are preferred, and operation at millimeter (mm)-wave bands where a combination of digital and analog techniques are needed to keep cost and power low.},

  Abstract                 = {Cognitive tasks are essential for the modern applications of electronics, and rely on the capability to perform inference. The Von Neumann bottleneck is an important issue for such tasks, and emerging memory devices offer an opportunity to overcome this issue by fusing computing and memory, in nonvolatile instant on/off systems. A vision for accomplishing this is to use brain-inspired architectures, which excel at inference and do not differentiate between computing and memory. In this work, we use a neuroscience-inspired model of learning, spike-timing-dependent plasticity, to develop a bioinspired approach for programming memory devices, which naturally gives rise to an inference engine. The method is then adapted to different memory devices, including multivalued memories (cumulative memristive device, phase-change memory) and stochastic binary memories (conductive bridge memory, spin transfer torque magnetic tunnel junction). By means of system-level simulations, we investigate several applications, including image recognition and pattern detection within video and auditory data. We compare the results of the different devices. Stochastic binary devices require the use of redundancy, the extent of which depends tremendously on the considered task. A theoretical analysis allows us to understand how the various devices differ, and ties the inference engine to the machine learning algorithm of expectation-maximization. Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate an exceptional robustness of the inference engine with respect to device variations and other issues. A theoretical analysis explains the roots of this robustness. These results highlight a possible new bioinspired paradigm for programming emerging memory devices, allowing the natural learning of a complex inference engine. The physics of the memory devices plays an active role. The results open the way for a reinvention of the role of memory, when solving inference tasks.},

As a result, spectrum resources are in ever-greater demand and the radio spectrum has become overly crowded. For efficient usage of spectrum, smart or cognitive radios are sought after. However, current wireless phones can only select a few specific bands. In this paper, we discuss the advantages of reconfigurable radios in not only increasing the efficiency of spectrum usage but also in potentially reducing the cost of wireless handsets and the barriers for new wireless service providers to enter the market. We review available technologies that make the implementation of reconfigurable radios possible and discuss technical challenges that need to be overcome before multistandard reconfigurable radios are put into practice.

  Abstract                 = {Information security has emerged as an important system and application metric. Classical security solutions use algorithmic mechanisms that address a small subset of emerging security requirements, often at high-energy and performance overhead. Further, emerging side-channel and physical attacks can compromise classical security solutions. Hardware security solutions overcome many of these limitations with less energy and performance overhead. Nanoelectronics-based hardware security preserves these advantages while enabling conceptually new security primitives and applications. This tutorial paper shows how one can develop hardware security primitives by exploiting the unique characteristics such as complex device and system models, bidirectional operation, and nonvolatility of emerging nanoelectronic devices. This paper then explains the security capabilities of several emerging nanoelectronic devices: memristors, resistive random-access memory, contact-resistive random-access memory, phase change memories, spin torque-transfer random-access memory, orthogonal spin transfer random access memory, graphene, carbon nanotubes, silicon nanowire field-effect transistors, and nanoelectronic mechanical switches. Further, the paper describes hardware security primitives for authentication, key generation, data encryption, device identification, digital forensics, tamper detection, and thwarting reverse engineering. Finally, the paper summarizes the outstanding challenges in using emerging nanoelectronic devices for security.},

  Abstract                 = {For individuals with high spinal cord injury (SCI), restoring missing grasping function is a high priority. Neuroprostheses based on functional electrical stimulation (FES) can partly compensate the loss of upper extremity function in people suffering from tetraplegia. With noninvasive, multichannel neuroprostheses a pinch and power grasp can be accomplished for everyday use. Hybrid systems combining FES with active orthoses hold promise for restoring a completely lost arm function. Novel control interfaces are needed to make full use of the many degrees of freedom of complex hybrid neuroprostheses. Motor imagery (MI)-based brain-computer interfaces (BCIs) are an emerging technology that may serve as a valuable adjunct to traditional control interfaces for neuroprosthetic control. Shared control and context-specific autonomy are most effective for reducing the users' workload. The modularity of upper extremity neuroprostheses as well as their associated control interfaces enable customization of the systems to adapt to the impairment and needs of each individual end user. This work provides an overview of the application of noninvasive hybrid BCI-controlled upper extremity neuroprostheses in individuals with high SCI with a strong focus on the results from the European Integrated Project Tools for Brain-Computer Interaction and will describe the challenges and promises for the future.},

Examples include demand-side management programs, incorporation of consumer-owned energy storage or renewable energy units, and active energy trading. However, despite the foreseen technological benefits of such consumer-centric grid features, to date, their widespread adoption in practice remains modest. To shed light on this challenge, this paper explores the potential of prospect theory, a Nobel-prize winning theory, as a decision-making framework that can help understand how risk and uncertainty can impact the decisions of smart grid consumers. After introducing the basic notions of prospect theory, several examples drawn from a number of smart grid applications are developed. These results show that a better understanding of the role of human decision making within the smart grid is paramount for optimizing its operation and expediting the deployment of its various technologies.},

  Abstract                 = {Time-triggered architectures form an important component of many distributed computing platforms for safety-critical real-time applications such as avionics and automotive control systems. TTA, FlexRay, and TTCAN are examples of such time-triggered architectures that have been popular in recent times. These architectures involve a number of algorithms for synchronizing a set of distributed computing nodes for meaningful exchange of data among them. The algorithms include a startup algorithm whose job is to integrate one or more nodes into the group of communicating nodes. The startup algorithm runs on every node when the system is powered up, and again after a failure occurs. Some critical issues need to be considered in the design of the startup algorithms, for example, the algorithms should be robust under reasonable assumptions of failures of nodes and channels. The safety-critical nature of the applications where these algorithms are used demands rigorous verification of these algorithms, and there have been numerous attempts to use formal verification techniques for this purpose. This paper focuses on various formal verification efforts carried out for ensuring the correctness of the startup algorithms. In particular, the verification of different startup algorithms used in three time-triggered architectures, TTA, FlexRay, and TTCAN, is studied, compared, and contrasted. Besides presenting the various verification approaches for these algorithms, the gaps and possible improvements on the verification efforts are also indicated.},

  Abstract                 = {Keeping up with growing electricity demand and ensuring reliable grid operation, as renewable sources reach a large proportion of generation, require end-use facilities-commercial, residential, and industrial-to be sensitive and responsive to grid connections in new ways. Automated demand response (ADR) is widely acknowledged as a key approach. The technology has progressed substantially since early implementations, with worldwide projects and a new standard. Recent applications with grid-integrated buildings and microgrids are extending the functionality, with increasing sophistication of how demand-side load profiles are managed and with integration of distributed storage and generation. This paper reviews the motivation for demand response (DR) and outlines the architectural models, technology infrastructure, and communication and control protocols that are currently in use. Four projects for commercial buildings and microgrids, in the United States, United Kingdom, and China, are described. We also point out limitations of the state of the practice that represent opportunities for research and development. Several research topics are noted, focusing on needs for modeling, optimization, and control, and some preliminary related work is discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Information theoretic approaches to security have been examined as a promising complement to current cryptographic techniques. Such information theoretic approaches establish reliable communication and data confidentiality directly at the physical layer of a communication network by taking the properties of the noisy channel into account leading to unconditional security regardless of the computational capabilities of eavesdroppers. The provision of accurate channel state information is a major challenge particularly in wireless communication systems, especially information about the channels to eavesdroppers. In addition, there might be malevolent adversaries who jam or influence the channel of the legitimate users. This paper surveys different models for secure communication under channel uncertainty and adversarial attacks and reviews the corresponding secrecy capacity results, which characterize the maximum rate at which information can be sent to legitimate receivers while being kept perfectly security from eavesdroppers.},

  Abstract                 = {Retrofitting the existing building stock is among the most important objectives and imperative to meet societal goals to reduce primary energy demand and anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. District heating systems have proven to supply heat for buildings both energy and cost efficiently. Thermal microgrids (TMGs) can be understood as a subcategory of district heating systems: small scale, bidirectional, and potentially fed by different thermal sources. Given a suitable combination of loads, the number of and distance between buildings, they can offer economic and environmental advantages compared to the supply by individual heating systems per building. We present a novel method using data analysis techniques on georeferenced building stock data to identify suitable configurations of buildings that yield a cost-efficient TMG. For the identification, both semantic and spatial data from a database are combined using fuzzy logics and cost-benefit analysis. We apply the method using a case study featuring a database of 306 buildings potentially to be retrofitted. As a result, we can identify nine groups of 25 buildings that would form a microgrid featuring up to 17.4% cost benefits compared to an individual heat supply. This would save approximately 30% of the building-induced CO2 emission of the community.},

In this paper, we characterize two trends that show great promise in meeting these challenges. The first trend is to perform verification by reduction to synthesis. The second is to solve the resulting synthesis problem by integrating traditional, deductive methods with inductive inference (learning from examples) using hypotheses about system structure. We present a formalization of such an integration, show how it can tackle hard problems in verification and synthesis, and outline directions for future work.},

  Abstract                 = {Big Data applications are typically associated with systems involving large numbers of users, massive complex software systems, and large-scale heterogeneous computing and storage architectures. The construction of such systems involves many distributed design choices. The end products (e.g., recommendation systems, medical analysis tools, real-time game engines, speech recognizers) thus involve many tunable configuration parameters. These parameters are often specified and hard-coded into the software by various developers or teams. If optimized jointly, these parameters can result in significant improvements. Bayesian optimization is a powerful tool for the joint optimization of design choices that is gaining great popularity in recent years. It promises greater automation so as to increase both product quality and human productivity. This review paper introduces Bayesian optimization, highlights some of its methodological aspects, and showcases a wide range of applications.},

  Abstract                 = {Electronic design automation (EDA) has enabled the integrated circuit industry to sustain exponentially increasing product complexity growth until today, while maintaining consistent product development timeline and costs. We argue that the success of EDA-based design relies on the application of four interrelated principles: 1) separation of concerns implying a decomposition of a design flow into steps, each step dealing with specific aspects, namely user requirements, functional design, and implementation; 2) component-based design enabling the reasoned construction of complex systems as the composition of components; 3) semantic coherency meaning that descriptions used in successive design steps are semantically related through adequate semantic mappings; this implies, in particular, that the formalisms used at each design step are rooted in well-defined semantics; and 4) correctness by construction meaning that it is possible to guarantee essential properties of the designed system incrementally and compositionally along the design process. The paper discusses to what extent the EDA paradigm can be adapted to general mixed hardware/software (HW/SW) systems design through the application of these principles. It presents an overview of the problems raised by the rigorous system design of mixed HW/SW systems. Then, it presents a unified abstract framework for addressing these problems by identifying main research avenues.},

  Abstract                 = {The development of a trustworthy smart grid requires a deeper understanding of potential impacts resulting from successful cyber attacks. Estimating feasible attack impact requires an evaluation of the grid's dependency on its cyber infrastructure and its ability to tolerate potential failures. A further exploration of the cyber-physical relationships within the smart grid and a specific review of possible attack vectors is necessary to determine the adequacy of cybersecurity efforts. This paper highlights the significance of cyber infrastructure security in conjunction with power application security to prevent, mitigate, and tolerate cyber attacks. A layered approach is introduced to evaluating risk based on the security of both the physical power applications and the supporting cyber infrastructure. A classification is presented to highlight dependencies between the cyber-physical controls required to support the smart grid and the communication and computations that must be protected from cyber attack. The paper then presents current research efforts aimed at enhancing the smart grid's application and infrastructure security. Finally, current challenges are identified to facilitate future research efforts.},

  Abstract                 = {Printing as a manufacturing technique is a promising approach to fabricate low-cost, flexible, and large area electronics. Over the last two decades, a wide range of applications has been explored, among them displays, sensors, and printed radio-frequency identification devices. Some of these turned out to be challenging to commercialize due to the required infrastructure investment, accuracy or performance expectations compared to incumbent technologies. However, the progress in terms of material science, device, and process technology now makes it possible to target some realistic applications such as printed sensor labels. The journey leading to this exciting opportunity has been complex. This review describes the experience and current efforts in developing the technology at PARC, a Xerox Company. Printed smart labels open up low-cost solutions for tracking and sensing applications that require high volumes and/or would benefit from disposability. Examples include radiation tags, one-time use medical sensors, tracking the temperature of pharmaceuticals at the item level, and monitoring food sources for spoilage and contamination. Higher performance can be achieved with printed hybrid electronics, integrating microchip-based signal processing, wireless communication, sensing, multiplexing, as well as ancillary passive elements for low-profile microelectronic devices, opening up further applications. This technology offers custom circuitry for demanding applications and is complementary to mass printed transistor circuits. As an example, we describe a prototype sense-and-transmit system, focusing particularly on issues of integration, such as impedance matching between the sensor and circuits, robust printed interconnection of the chips, and compatible interface electronics between printed and discrete parts. Next-generation technologies will enable printing of entire smart systems using microchip inks. A new printing concept for the directed assembly of silicon - icrochips into functional circuits is described. The process is scalable and has the potential to enable additive, digital manufacturing of high-performance electronic systems.},

The printing requirements of printed electronics are substantially different that those of graphic arts. To make printed electronics a reality, it is necessary to deliver high resolution, good reproducibility, excellent pattern fidelity, high process throughput, and compatibility with the requisite semiconductor, dielectric, and conductor inks. In this paper, we review the physics of pattern formation from pixelated primitives, such as those that exist during inkjet and gravure printing, and will show how control of drop merging and drying can be used to produce high-fidelity shapes, including lines, squares, and intersections. We additionally discuss the physical underpinnings of gravure printing and inkjet printing, and show how these techniques can be scaled to produce high-fidelity highly scaled patterns, including sub-2 micron features at printing speeds of ~1 m/s. Finally, in conjunction with high-performance materials, we describe our realization of high-performance fully printed transistors on plastic, offering high-switching speed, excellent process throughput, and good fidelity over large areas.},

Early diagnosis of cervical cancer allows patients to be fully treated. Therefore, there is high clinical utility of HPV diagnostics even with binary positive/negative indication of the presence of HPV in patient samples. Although the Pap smear is widely used for cervical cancer screening, this method still suffers from low sensitivity and specificity. Thus, simple, rapid and inexpensive diagnostic methods are needed to detect the etiology of cervical cancer, i.e., HPV, especially high-risk oncogenic subtypes 16 and 18. Here, we review the existing assays and platforms employed for HPV diagnosis, and highlight recent advances in nanotechnology and microfluidics that potentially enable new approaches for HPV diagnosis.},

Smallest critical dimensions on a chip are in nanometers and the largest are in centimeters. Within the device themselves, 3-D, 2-D, 1-D, or even 0-D effects and their properties may be employed. This integrated circuit ensemble in its present form manipulates the information for an informational objective under constraints, among many, of energy, time, and absolute correctness. Four example sets illustrating the consequences of this approach arising from statistical, thermodynamic, quantum-mechanic, and information mechanic considerations are analyzed. The first illustrates the implication on a minimum in energy in any binary state change of >250kB T. The second illustrates the connection between the nature of memory mechanism to the fluctuations and their guiding statistics that lead to the variability and errors. The third illustrates the limits arising in dissipative access due to dimensionality change. The fourth illustrates the interaction between fluctuations and on-chip signal transmission and manipulation with their resultant constraints. We tie this analysis to devices aimed at subthreshold conduction control, the change to on-state and low voltage operations. These examples illustrate the constraints placed on the reductive march through the connections of scales that leave the electronic ensemble nearly nine orders of magnitude off the thermodynamic capacity in information efficiency.

  Abstract                 = {Since their introduction, field programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) have grown in capacity by more than a factor of 10 $thinspace$000 and in performance by a factor of 100. Cost and energy per operation have both decreased by more than a factor of 1000. These advances have been fueled by process technology scaling, but the FPGA story is much more complex than simple technology scaling. Quantitative effects of Moore's Law have driven qualitative changes in FPGA architecture, applications and tools. As a consequence, FPGAs have passed through several distinct phases of development. These phases, termed ÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂAgesÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂ in this paper, are The Age of Invention, The Age of Expansion and The Age of Accumulation. This paper summarizes each and discusses their driving pressures and fundamental characteristics. The paper concludes with a vision of the upcoming Age of FPGAs.},

It uses tools from information theory and coding and yields provable security, even against an adversary with unbounded computational power. However, the feasibility of this approach in practice depends on the development of efficiently implementable schemes. In this paper, we review a special class of practical schemes for information-theoretic security that are based on 2-universal hash families. Specific cases of secret key agreement and wiretap coding are considered, and general themes are identified. The scheme presented for wiretap coding is modular and can be implemented easily by including an extra preprocessing layer over the existing transmission codes.},

  Abstract                 = {Infrastructural systems such as the electricity grid, healthcare, and transportation networks today rely increasingly on the joint functioning of networked information systems and physical components, in short, on cyber-physical architectures. Despite tremendous advances in cryptography, physical-layer security and authentication, information attacks, both passive such as eavesdropping, and active such as unauthorized data injection, continue to thwart the reliable functioning of networked systems. In systems with joint cyber-physical functionality, the ability of an adversary to monitor transmitted information or introduce false information can lead to sensitive user data being leaked or result in critical damages to the underlying physical system. This paper investigates two broad challenges in information security in cyber-physical systems (CPSs): preventing retrieval of internal physical system information through monitored external cyber flows, and limiting the modification of physical system functioning through compromised cyber flows. A rigorous analytical framework grounded on information-theoretic security is developed to study these challenges in a general stochastic control system abstraction-a theoretical building block for CPSs-with the objectives of quantifying the fundamental tradeoffs between information security and physical system performance, and through the process, designing provably secure controller policies. Recent results are presented that establish the theoretical basis for the framework, in addition to practical applications in timing analysis of anonymous systems, and demand response systems in a smart electricity grid.},

  Abstract                 = {By enabling diverse and large-scale transducers, large-area electronics raises the potential for electronic systems to interact much more extensively with the physical world than is possible today. This can substantially expand the scope of applications, both in number and in value. But first, translation into applications requires a base of system functions (instrumentation, computation, power management, communication). These cannot be realized on the desired scale by large-area electronics alone. It is necessary to combine large-area electronics with high-performance, high-efficiency technologies, such as crystalline silicon CMOS, within hybrid systems. Scalable hybrid systems require rethinking the subsystem architectures from the start by considering how the technologies should be interfaced, on both a functional and physical level. To explore platform architectures along with the supporting circuits and devices, we consider as an application driver, a self-powered sheet for high-resolution structural health monitoring (of bridges and buildings). Top-down evaluation of design alternatives within the hybrid design space and pursuit of template architectures exposes circuit functions and device optimizations traditionally overlooked by bottom-up approaches alone.},

  Abstract                 = {An important step in the design of a complex system is its decomposition into a number of interacting components, of which some are given (known) and some need to be synthesized (unknown). Then a basic task in the design flow is to synthesize an unknown component that when combined with the known part of the system (the context) satisfies a given specification. This problem arises in several applications ranging from sequential synthesis to the design of discrete controllers. There are different formulations of the problem, depending on the formal models to specify the system and its components, the composition operators, and the conformance relations of the composed system versus the specification. Various behavioral models have been studied in the literature, e.g., finite state machines and automata, omega-automata, process algebras; various forms of synchronous and asynchronous (interleaving/parallel) composition have been considered; the conformance relations include language containment and equality, and notions of simulation. In this paper we give an overview of the problem (a.k.a., the unkown component problem, or submodule construction, etc.), and we focus on its reduction to solving equations over languages, as a key technology for supporting synthesis of compositional systems. We survey the state-of-art and highlight open problems requiring further investigation.},

SAT has many applications in electronic design automation (EDA), notably in synthesis and verification. Consequently, SAT has received much attention from the EDA community, who developed algorithms that have had a significant impact on the performance of SAT solvers. EDA researchers introduced techniques such as conflict-driven clause learning, novel branching heuristics, and efficient unit propagation. These techniques form the basis of all modern SAT solvers. Using these ideas, contemporary SAT solvers can often handle practical instances with millions of variables and constraints. The continuing advances of SAT solvers are the driving force of modern model checking tools, which are used to check the correctness of hardware designs. Contemporary automated verification techniques such as bounded model checking, proof-based abstraction, interpolation-based model checking, and IC3 have in common that they are all based on SAT solvers and their extensions. In this paper, we trace the most important contributions made to modern SAT solvers by the EDA community, and discuss applications of SAT in hardware model checking.},

Their benefits on power converter efficiency and power density are explained through a case study of a medium-voltage (MV) class motor drive system. SiC and GaN also enable new applications, including solid-state transformers, while posing new design and application challenges such as gate drive, protection, and interaction with loads. In addition to device related topics, this paper also overviews other important advances in power electronics, including topology, control, passive components, thermal management, filters, and packaging.

  Abstract                 = {The explosive growth in Big Data has attracted much attention in designing efficient indexing and search methods recently. In many critical applications such as large-scale search and pattern matching, finding the nearest neighbors to a query is a fundamental research problem. However, the straightforward solution using exhaustive comparison is infeasible due to the prohibitive computational complexity and memory requirement. In response, approximate nearest neighbor (ANN) search based on hashing techniques has become popular due to its promising performance in both efficiency and accuracy. Prior randomized hashing methods, e.g., locality-sensitive hashing (LSH), explore data-independent hash functions with random projections or permutations. Although having elegant theoretic guarantees on the search quality in certain metric spaces, performance of randomized hashing has been shown insufficient in many real-world applications. As a remedy, new approaches incorporating data-driven learning methods in development of advanced hash functions have emerged. Such learning-to-hash methods exploit information such as data distributions or class labels when optimizing the hash codes or functions. Importantly, the learned hash codes are able to preserve the proximity of neighboring data in the original feature spaces in the hash code spaces. The goal of this paper is to provide readers with systematic understanding of insights, pros, and cons of the emerging techniques. We provide a comprehensive survey of the learning-to-hash framework and representative techniques of various types, including unsupervised, semisupervised, and supervised. In addition, we also summarize recent hashing approaches utilizing the deep learning models. Finally, we discuss the future direction and trends of research in this area.},

More recent work has extended the range of applications to other types of arrays, including aperture arrays (AAs) and phased array feeds (PAFs) for multibeam reflector antennas. The extreme sensitivity required for astronomical instrumentation is driving advances in numerical electromagnetic modeling, design optimization of large arrays, low noise amplifiers, minimization of receiver noise, cryogenic PAFs, array calibration, optimal beamforming, interferometric imaging, and array signal processing algorithms for radio-frequency interference mitigation. We give an overview of research progress, current and planned array-based instruments, and open challenges in these areas related to the new generation of sparse arrays, PAFs, and AAs that are in development for astronomical observatories around the world.},

We describe the state of the standardization work, the major issues being discussed, and open questions recently identified.

  Abstract                 = {In the past decade or so we have witnessed a steadily increasing interest in FPGAs as hardware accelerators: they provide an excellent mid-point between the reprogrammability of software devices (CPUs, DSPs, and GPUs) and the performance and low energy consumption of ASICs. However, the programmability of FPGA-based accelerators remains one of the biggest obstacles to their wider adoption. Developing FPGA programs requires extensive familiarity with hardware design and experience with a tedious and complex tool chain. For half a century, layers of abstractions have been developed that simplify the software development process: languages, compilers, dynamically linked libraries, operating systems, APIs, etc. Very little, if any, such abstractions exist in the development of FPGA programs. In this paper, we review the history of using FPGAs as hardware accelerators and summarize the challenges facing the raising of the programming abstraction layers. We survey five High-Level Language tools for the development of FPGA programs: Xilinx Vivado, Altera OpenCL, BluespecBSV, ROCCC, and LegUp to provide an overview of their tool flow, the optimizations they provide, and a qualitative analysis of their hardware implementations of high level code.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, the shrinking of the personal computer market has given a clear signal that it is time to divert our focus from the strategy of miniaturization of transistors to a different strategy with emerging technologies. As a new form of electronics, stretchable electronics has significantly advanced in the past few years by micro/nanofabrication of thin films of traditional stiff and hard materials such as silicon, metals, and ceramics, and especially subsequent transfer process on an elastic substrate. However, such a thin structure often suffers from high resistance that leads to low performance when long structures are required. This is particularly true for antennas in radio-frequency (RF) electronics. By introducing microfluidics into RF electronics, we found out that it was an excellent way to make high-performance stretchable RF electronics. Apart from antennas, the microfluidic approach was also adopted and further developed to various devices with integrated wireless communication. This fusion of microfluidics with RF electronics brings not only a lot of opportunities for researchers as a radically new research field, but also potentially commercial benefits for industry. As a new emerging field, a huge effort, ranging from fundamental science to technology development, is required to realize it. This paper illustrates the fundamentals in processing and relevant applications, and highlights recent advances in microfluidic RF electronics. The authors would like to inspire the electronics community to further exploit the advantages of this approach and accelerate innovations in this field.},

  Abstract                 = {We revisit the recent secure degrees of freedom (s.d.o.f.) results for one-hop multiuser wireless networks by considering three fundamental wireless network structures: Gaussian wiretap channel with helpers, Gaussian multiple access wiretap channel, and Gaussian interference channel with secrecy constraints. We present main enabling tools and resulting communication schemes in an expository manner, along with key insights and design principles emerging from them. The main achievable schemes are based on real interference alignment, channel prefixing via cooperative jamming, and structured signalling. Real interference alignment enables aligning the cooperative jamming signals together with the message carrying signals at the eavesdroppers to protect them akin to one-time-pad protecting messages in wired systems. Real interference alignment also enables decodability at the legitimate receivers by rendering message carrying and cooperative jamming signals separable, and simultaneously aligning the cooperative jamming signals in the smallest possible subspace. The main converse techniques are based on two key lemmas which quantify the secrecy penalty by showing that the net effect of an eavesdropper on the system is that it eliminates one of the independent channel inputs; and the role of a helper by developing a direct relationship between the cooperative jamming signal of a helper and the message rate. These two lemmas when applied according to the unique structure of individual networks provide tight converses. Finally, we present a blind cooperative jamming scheme for the helper network with no eavesdropper channel state information at the transmitters that achieves the same optimal s.d.o.f. as in the case of full eavesdropper channel state information.},

Three separate groups in Japan are actively developing superconducting motors for marine propulsion. The Tokyo University of Marine Science and Technology group developed the world's first axial-gap coreless high-temperature superconducting motor (HTS) with a 100-kW output for a liquid neon thermosiphon cooled superconducting machine over a period from 2004 to 2007. The IHI Corporation group has developed four types of axial-type HTS motors since 2004. Using a cooling system based on liquid nitrogen, they achieved the world's highest output at 365 kW in 2007. The Kawasaki Heavy Industries group has been developing radial-type HTS motors since 2007. In 2010, the group developed a 1-MW motor that achieved an output of 450 kW. In 2013, the group also developed a 3-MW motor that achieved an output of 3 MW. Furthermore, the group has developed key hardware technologies for a 20-MW motor.},

  Abstract                 = {In this era of large-scale data, distributed systems built on top of clusters of commodity hardware provide cheap and reliable storage and scalable processing of massive data. With cheap storage, instead of storing only currently relevant data, it is common to store as much data as possible, hoping that its value can be extracted later. In this way, exabytes (1018 bytes) of data are being created on a daily basis. Extracting value from these data, however, requires scalable implementations of advanced analytical algorithms beyond simple data processing, e.g., statistical regression methods, linear algebra, and optimization algorithms. Most such traditional methods are designed to minimize floating-point operations, which is the dominant cost of in-memory computation on a single machine. In parallel and distributed environments, however, load balancing and communication, including disk and network input/output (I/O), can easily dominate computation. These factors greatly increase the complexity of algorithm design and challenge traditional ways of thinking about the design of parallel and distributed algorithms. Here, we review recent work on developing and implementing randomized matrix algorithms in large-scale parallel and distributed environments. Randomized algorithms for matrix problems have received a great deal of attention in recent years, thus far typically either in theory or in machine learning applications or with implementations on a single machine.},

Supporting unified designs of both time-triggered and event-triggered tasks facilitates the integration of CPS applications. This paper presents a mixed time/event-triggered architecture called MixCPS to make CPS applications work in the integrated and optimized manner. To optimize MixCPS, we propose a new timing performance metric for CPS applications, i.e., the application-level delay, which is induced from sensor to actuator and captures the coupling between cyber and physical worlds. Using the system-level time-triggered scheduling based on the synchronization between computation and communication nodes, we optimize the assignment of computation tasks and the packet transmissions in order to minimize the application-level delays. Furthermore, we discuss the scheduling policy for event-trigged tasks after the resource reservation for time-trigged tasks. Finally, the proposed MixCPS is evaluated by several simulations which show that the application-level delays can be significantly reduced through the time-triggered cooperation mechanism of computation and communication.},

The onshore and offshore wind farm configurations are analyzed with respect to the series/parallel connection of wind turbine ac/dc output terminals, and high voltage ac/dc transmission. The fault-ride through compliance methods used in the induction and synchronous generator based WECS are also discussed. The past, present and future trends in megawatt WECS are reviewed in terms of mechanical and electrical technologies, integration to power systems, and control theory.

The past decade has seen an unprecedented effort in physical-layer security research resulting in promising new design insights. The majority of these advances has been in wireless communications security, well-motivated by the fact that most data at large, including those of sensitive nature, flow over wireless links that are more vulnerable to security breaches, e.g., eavesdropping. At the same time, the open broadcast nature of wireless brings possibilities of cooperation by the network entities for improving security, e.g., resistance to eavesdropping.

  Abstract                 = {Recent communication, computation, and technology advances coupled with climate change concerns have transformed the near future prospects of electricity transmission, and, more notably, distribution systems and microgrids. Distributed resources (wind and solar generation, combined heat and power) and flexible loads (storage, computing, EV, HVAC) make it imperative to increase investment and improve operational efficiency. Commercial and residential buildings, being the largest energy consumption group among flexible loads in microgrids, have the largest potential and flexibility to provide demand-side management. Recent advances in networked systems and the anticipated breakthroughs of the Internet of Things will enable significant advances in demand-response capabilities of intelligent load networks of power-consuming devices such as HVAC components, water heaters, EV charging stations, and many more. In this paper, a new operating framework, called packetized direct load control (PDLC), is proposed based on the notion of quantization of energy demand. This control protocol is built on top of two communication protocols that carry either complete or binary information regarding the operation status of appliances. We discuss the optimal demand-side operation for both protocols and analytically derive the performance differences between the protocols. We propose an optimal reservation strategy for traditional and renewable energy for the PDLC in both day-ahead and real-time markets. At the end of the paper, we discuss the fundamental tradeoff between achieving controllability and endowing consumer choice and flexibility.},

  Abstract                 = {Rapidly diversifying technology and declining computational costs are popularizing technologically flexible simulation and verification techniques, even at some cost in performance. This paper investigates a data-driven, sampling-based approach for computing substrate Green's functions, which is more technology flexible than specialized layered media methods, at the cost of speed and accuracy. Our method is based on assuming that grid-sampled Green's functions can be well approximated by Toeplitz-plus-Hankel (TPH) matrices, and uses a least squares procedure to recover a TPH matrix from a small number of samples. We show that sample location is crucial, and that good sample locations are the ones that minimize an associated graph-diameter-based condition number estimate. The method's expected effectiveness is demonstrated on noise-polluted samples of layered media Green's functions. More surprisingly, we show that the method is effective even when applied to a substrate geometry that is only mildly planar.},

Various component analysis methods have played an increasingly important role for the analysis of such coupled data. In this article, we first provide a brief review of existing matrix-based (two-way) component analysis methods for the joint analysis of such data with a focus on biomedical applications. Then, we discuss their important extensions and generalization to multiblock multiway (tensor) data. We show how constrained multiblock tensor decomposition methods are able to extract similar or statistically dependent common features that are shared by all blocks, by incorporating the multiway nature of data. Special emphasis is given to the flexible common and individual feature analysis of multiblock data with the aim to simultaneously extract common and individual latent components with desired properties and types of diversity. Illustrative examples are given to demonstrate their effectiveness for biomedical data analysis.},

The resultant structural and electronic phase transitions provide an elegant way to encode, store, and process information. In this review, we examine the utilization of Mott metal-to-insulator transitions, for memory and neuromorphic devices. We emphasize the overarching electron-phonon coupling and electron-electron interaction-driven transition mechanisms and kinetics, which renders a general description of Mott memories from aspects such as nonvolatility, sensing scheme, read/write speed, and switching energy. Various memory and neuromorphic device architectures incorporating phase transition elements are reviewed, focusing on their operational principles. The role of Peierls distortions and crystal symmetry changes during phase change is discussed. Prospects for such orbitronic devices as hardware components for information technologies are summarized.},

  Abstract                 = {Modern high-speed networks have evolved from relatively static networks to highly adaptive networks facilitating dynamic reconfiguration. This evolution has influenced all levels of network design and management, introducing increased programmability and configuration flexibility. This influence has extended from the lowest level of physical hardware interfaces to the highest level of network management by software. A key representative of this evolution is the emergence of software-defined networking (SDN). In this paper, we review the current state of the art in reconfigurable network systems, covering hardware reconfiguration, SDN, and the interplay between them. We take a top-down approach, starting with a tutorial on software-defined networks. We then continue to discuss programming languages as the linking element between different levels of software and hardware in the network. We review electronic switching systems, highlighting programmability and reconfiguration aspects, and describe the trends in reconfigurable network elements. Finally, we describe the state of the art in the integration of photonic transceiver and switching elements with electronic technologies, and consider the implications for SDN and reconfigurable network systems.},

In this class of models, a transmitter sends multiple messages to a set of legitimate receivers in the presence of a set of eavesdroppers, whose channels can be ordered based on the quality of received signals. Receivers with better channel quality are required to decode more messages, and eavesdroppers with worse channel quality are required to be kept ignorant of more messages. The design of achievable schemes and the characterization of the corresponding secrecy capacity regions are presented. Comparison of the designs for different models is discussed. Applications of these information-theoretic models to the study of secure communication over fading wiretap channels and secret sharing are also presented to illustrate potential applications of these models.},
