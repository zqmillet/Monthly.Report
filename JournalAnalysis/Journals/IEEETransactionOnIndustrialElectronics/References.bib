  Abstract                 = {Currently, most of the capacitive deionization (CDI) research is oriented to improving the electrode materials. However, if the CDI overall efficiency is to be improved, it is necessary to optimize the CDI cell geometry and the charge/discharge current used during the deionization process. In this paper, an experimental CDI module is electrically characterized, and its performance is derived by solving the differential equations that represent the behavior of a total system. The solving method, which provides a detailed description of energy losses, is applied to a set of theoretical CDI modules whose properties are related to those of actual modules. This allows the extrapolation of the performance obtained to that of other modules with different geometries. From this information, it is possible to derive the optimum geometry that gives rise to the highest efficiency in the whole system for each charging current. The system equations allow an optimal charging current to be derived and an optimal energy-recovery performance to be achieved for any CDI cell. This charging current is a function of parasitic resistances and voltages on the cells along the energy transfer. The theoretical results are compared to experimental measurements conducted on actual CDI cells; good agreement with theoretical predictions was observed.},

This paper studies the power losses in a 90-kW converter-fed SynRM drive by a calorimetric method in comparison of the traditional input-output method. After the converter and the motor were measured simultaneously in separate chambers, the converter was installed inside the large-size chamber next to the motor and the total drive system losses were obtained using one chamber.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the steady-state mathematical model of a five-phase induction machine with a combined star/pentagon connection. The connection splits the stator winding into two five-phase windings displaced in space by $pi$/10 and connected in a combined star/pentagon configuration. Recent work limited to an experimental investigation demonstrated that the connection possesses improved fault tolerance when compared to a conventional star-connected stator, as well as avoids the pentagon connection problems. Although the machine has five-phase terminals, it is intrinsically an asymmetrical ten-phase machine, which introduces additional subspaces in the machine's mathematical model. In order to theoretically investigate and thoroughly assess this connection against conventional connections, this paper introduces the steady-state mathematical model based on vector space decomposition and symmetrical component theory. Finite-element analysis is first used to investigate the different harmonic current components induced in the cage rotor circuit, upon which the effect of different subspaces can be clarified and the required transformation matrix from phase variables to their sequence components can be derived. The model is verified using a 1-kW prototype five-phase induction machine.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the main merits offered by multiphase machines is their high fault-tolerant capability. Literature has demonstrated that the performance of multiphase induction machines under fault conditions is affected by the employed stator winding connection. In open-loop controlled five-phase machines, the star connection is favorable under healthy conditions while the pentagon connection is favorable and yields a lower derating factor under the open phase condition. In this paper, a new combined star/pentagon single layer winding layout that combines the advantages of both star and pentagon connections is proposed for a five-phase induction machine. Although the proposed winding is intrinsically an asymmetrical ten-phase machine, the proposed connection allows for only five-phase terminals. Moreover, the proposed winding not only yields better flux distribution compared to a conventional single layer winding, but also provides a complete cancellation of the third-order harmonic flux component caused by the induced third sequence currents due to the saturation effect and/or under unbalanced operation. Hence, the machine losses are decreased, which improves the overall machine efficiency. For the healthy case, the machine is similar to a conventional star connected five-phase machine. However, with one phase open, the proposed connection results in a lower derating factor compared to conventional connections for both open-loop and optimal current control techniques. A 1-kW prototype machine is used for experimental verification.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a novel weighted memory polynomial (WMP)-based model is proposed for wireless transmitters and radio-frequency power amplifiers' (PAs) behavioral modeling and predistortion. The new model introduces an instantaneous-power-dependent weight function on the static and dynamic terms of the conventional memory polynomial (MP) model. Experimental validation in both modeling and predistortion contexts was performed on a PA prototype driven by a 20-MHz Long Term Evolution signal. The proposed model was assessed against the standard MP model. The experimental results demonstrate the superiority of the proposed polynomial in behavioral modeling applications as it results in up to 50% (3-dB) improvement in the normalized mean square error for the same number of coefficients. The model robustness was then validated by using a second test signal applied to two Doherty PAs using different transistor technologies. Furthermore, when applied for digital predistortion, the proposed WMP function achieves the same performance as the state-of-art MP while requiring approximately 50% less coefficients.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel 40-pulse ac-dc converter based on a 20-pulse converter is designed and implemented in this paper. Combining the outputs of two parallel 10-pulse diode bridges, consisting of five legs of diode rectifiers, results in a 20-pulse topology. A zero sequence blocking transformer (ZSBT) is designed and applied to the proposed scheme guarantying the independent operation of the two bridges. To achieve a 40-pulse output, a pulse doubling circuit is applied which is inherently a tapped inter-phase transformer. A T-connected autotransformer platform is designed and added to the converter, making the proposed scheme suitable for retrofit applications. The proposed solution is a tradeoff among the pulse number, the transformer platform, the complexity of the scheme and the cost. The proposed scheme has an optimized configuration in this regard. In this paper, the proposed scheme is simulated by MATLAB/SIMULINK considering different loading scenarios. The simulation results show that the proposed scheme improves the power quality indices and satisfies the IEEE-519 requirements at the point of common coupling (PCC). Also, a laboratory prototype is implemented using the proposed design and the experimental results confirm the simulation results under different loading conditions. The important aspect of the proposed scheme is a considerable reduction in the burdens of the magnetic parts with respect to the nominal load rating which is verified by kVA calculation. This fact indicates a significant improvement in the total cost and space of the proposed configuration in comparison with similar configurations.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy storage systems have been widely applied in power distribution sectors as well as in renewable energy sources to ensure uninterruptible power supply. This paper proposes a modified model predictive control (MMPC) method based on the Lyapunov function to improve the performance of a bidirectional ac-dc converter, which is used in an energy storage system for bidirectional power transfer between the three-phase ac voltage supply and energy storage devices. The proposed control technique utilizes the discrete behavior of the converter, considering the unavoidable quantization errors between the controller and the control actions selected from the finite control set of the bidirectional ac-dc converter. The proposed control method reduces the execution time delay by 18% compared with the conventional model predictive control. Moreover, the nonlinear system stability of the proposed MMPC technique is ensured by the direct Lyapunov method and a nonlinear experimental system model. Detailed experimental results with a 2.5-kW downscaled hardware prototype are provided to show the efficacy of the proposed control system.},

  Abstract                 = {The flying capacitor multilevel inverter (FCMLI) is one of the well-known structures of multilevel inverters having attracted considerable attention because of its merits. In spite of its many advantages, it has some limitations such as high volume and complicated control method because of its bulky capacitors and their voltage balancing requirement. Moreover, the high number of power semiconductors required makes this structure susceptible to failure. To increase the ratio of the number of levels to the number of components, an uneven distribution of capacitor voltages has been suggested in previous reports; however, this approach complicates the control method. Up to now, almost all presented methods suffer from high computational load and/or structure-dependent algorithm. In this paper, a simple state-based and structure-independent method is proposed for capacitor voltage regulation. The proposed method is straightforward and can perform online computation of switching sequences in a computationally efficient manner without any need for stored information or look-up tables. The method is conveniently extendible to any number of cells and levels in an FCMLI structure with arbitrary dc link voltage distribution schemes. Simulation and experimental results show the effectiveness and simplicity of this method.},

First, a disturbance observer is established to estimate the overall effect of possible uncertainties and disturbances on the nominal vehicle model which is called the lumped disturbance. Then, a compensation method is proposed based on disturbance observer and feedback linearization control to counteract the mismatched lumped disturbance. Furthermore, a novel antiwindup modification is implemented on the baseline control to handle the possible input saturation. The designed controller addresses the issue of stability robustness with respect to system uncertainties and disturbances, and achieves zero-error tracking with good performance and antiwindup property meanwhile, which is the major merit compared with other existing AHV controllers.

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the use of MEMS accelerometers to improve the performances of positioning control systems equipped with low-resolution positioning sensors. A kinematic Kalman filter (KKF) is used to combine the position and acceleration measurements and get a smooth estimate of the kinematic variables, even in the presence of a coarse position quantization. Compared to similar schemes existing in literature, the state of the proposed KKF is augmented, to include the accelerometer output bias/drift among the variables estimated by the filter. In this way, the intrinsic robustness of the KKF scheme is further improved, by making the estimation process of the kinematic variables practically insensitive to the variation of the sensor bias/drift. The proposed KKF is used to provide a smooth and robust estimate of the kinematic variables to a positioning control system consisting of a two degrees-of-freedom (DOF) proportional-derivative (PD) position control combined with an acceleration-based disturbance observer (ADOB). Compared to a solution based on a conventional KKF, not accounting for the accelerometer output disturbance, the proposed solution exhibits better positioning performances, and insensitivity to the accelerometer output bias/drift. This feature is validated through several experimental tests on a positioning system based on a linear motor.},

PLL converters are tracking-type converters that use the sine and cosine signals of the transducer in a closed-loop arrangement aiming to match an estimated output angle to the true angle encoded in the sine and cosine input signals. Such a scheme requires means to determine the sine and cosine of the estimated output angle; conventional converters achieve this by using voltage-controlled oscillators, digital-to-analog converter (DAC), counter, and lookup tables. The proposed converter simplifies implementation by making use of the estimated output angle signal to approximate its sine and cosine using analog triangle-sine conversion technique. A new method is also proposed to enhance the dynamic performance of the converter enabling near instantaneous response. This paper describes the proposed method, full details of its analog implementation, and experimental results. Results demonstrate agreement with theory and computer simulation.},

This new algorithm is an improvement of an online ground-fault location method presented previously, in which the effect of the rotor capacitance has a high influence in the correct detection of the fault. The detection of the ground fault is performed by the supervision of the phase angle between two phasor voltages. The first one is the third-harmonic phasor voltage obtained from the measurement of the field voltage, which is used as a reference. The second one is the third-harmonic voltage phasor obtained by the measurement in a grounding resistance placed in the neutral of the excitation transformer. It allows not only detecting the ground fault along the field winding but also distinguishing the cases of ground fault in the rotor winding, from the cases of high influence of the rotor capacitance in healthy condition. This new algorithm has been tested with satisfactory results in a 106-MVA hydro generating unit.},

Dodecagonal voltage space vector structure eliminates fifth- and seventh-order harmonic voltages from phase voltage output and hence eliminates the fifth- and seventh-order harmonic currents through the motor leading to removal of the dominant sixth-order torque ripple generation in the motor over the entire modulation range. Multilevel space vector structure generates output voltage with better THD and low dv/dt. In the proposed topology, two three-level inverters drive an open-end winding IM, one inverter from each side. DC-link of primary inverter is from a dc source which delivers the entire active power, whereas the secondary inverter dc-link is maintained by a capacitor, which is self balanced during the inverter operation. The PWM scheme implemented ensures low switching frequency for primary inverter. Secondary inverter operates at a small dc-link voltage. Hence, switching losses are small for both primary and secondary inverters. Experimental results show the elimination of fifth- and seventh-order harmonic voltages over the entire modulation range, validating effectiveness of the proposed multilevel inverter scheme.},

An asymmetrical six-phase induction machine (IM) is proposed for this application. The main focus of this paper is on the control of the six-phase IM, to verify its overload capabilities and postfault operations. The implemented control uses a direct-flux vector control scheme based on a double-stator approach, where each three-phase winding set is independently controlled. This way, the fault-tolerant behavior of the drive system is enhanced. Complete details of the adopted flux observer are included; torque and speed control loops are implemented in a dedicated multiple three-phase drive, and a scaled prototype (10 kW, 6000 r/min) has been tested. The overload capability has been verified both in generation and motoring mode, for different speeds and torque up to 150% of the rated one. Finally, the transitions between healthy and faulty modes are reported for open phases and encoder faults. The obtained results demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed drive solutions.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an integrated, auto-reconfigurable power-supply network to enhance system lifetime and efficiency in self-reliant energy-harvesting applications. Carbon nanotube (CNT) supercapacitors are employed as both energy storage devices and power sources, thereby achieving multidirectional energy exchange. By leveraging advanced semiconductor processes, a low-volume, cost-effective single-inductor multiple-output (SIMO) power management unit (PMU) is developed, which connects all the supercapacitors into an autonomous power-supply network. The PMU enables reversible power flows, shorter power-delivery paths, and effective energy reutilization, which enhances the reliability and flexibility of the system. The use of CNT supercapacitors features small form factor and high energy/power density, making them highly attractive for power-constrained devices. A prototype of the PMU is fabricated with a 0.35-Î¼m N-well CMOS process, with a chip area of approximately 4.3 mm2. The PMU interconnects 3-CNT supercapacitors in the power-supply network, and operates from 1.5 to 3 V. The measured peak energy-transfer efficiency is 85.03%. The supercapacitors deliver an energy density of 6.2 Wh/kg, at a high power density of 79 kW/kg and exhibit excellent stability of 98.5% retention, at a current density of 50 A/g.},

  Abstract                 = {Although, the proton exchange membrane fuel cell is a promising clean and efficient energy converter that can be used to power an entire building in electricity and heat in a combined manner, it suffers from a limited lifespan due to degradation mechanisms. As a consequence, in the past years, researches have been conducted to estimate the state of health and now the remaining useful life (RUL) in order to extend the life of such devices. However, the developed methods are unable to perform prognostics with an online uncertainty quantification due to the computational cost. This paper aims at tackling this issue by proposing an observer-based prognostic algorithm. An extended Kalman filter estimates the actual state of health and the dynamic of the degradation with the associated uncertainty. An inverse first-order reliability method is used to extrapolate the state of health until a threshold is reached, for which the RUL is given with a 90% confidence interval. The global method is validated using a simulation model built from degradation data. Finally, the algorithm is tested on a dataset coming from a long-term experimental test on an eight-cell fuel cell stack subjected to a variable power profile.},

The proposed method is compared to the classical EMD and the ensemble EMD (EEMD). Advantages of the proposed method include a more adequate IMF extraction than the EMD technique, and a noticeable reduction of computational burden compared to the EEMD.

Changes to the flow geometry on the stator temperature distribution were investigated.

An SV is used for higher voltage cells to properly choose their voltage vectors in a way such as to avoid converter saturation, particularly under fault conditions. A generic algorithm to identify the domains of higher voltage vectors in which a reference lies, without the need for separation lines, is proposed. Then, to simplify the implementation of the algorithm, carrier-based modulation is employed for lower voltage cells, which switch with pulsewidth modulation. This suppresses the need for defining multiple switching sequences for different operational conditions, and it avoids converter saturation as much as possible, particularly under fault conditions on power cells. Simulation and experimental results for normal and faulty operational conditions are given, validating the theoretical analysis and demonstrating the good performance of the proposed hybrid modulation approach.},

A Kalman-filter-based estimation algorithm allows for obtaining the adhesion between the wheel and road surface and vehicle speed. These parameters are used in a fuzzy block to detect the road type.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a highly efficient asymmetrical pulse-width modulated (APWM) full-bridge converter for renewable energy sources. The proposed converter adopts full-bridge topology and asymmetric control scheme to achieve the zero-voltage switching (ZVS) turn-on of the power switches of the primary side and to reduce the circulating current loss. Moreover, the resonant circuit composed of the leakage inductance of the transformer and the blocking capacitor provides the zero-current switching (ZCS) turn-off for the output diode without the help of any auxiliary circuits. Thus, the reverse recovery problem of the output diode is eliminated. In addition, voltage stresses of the power switches are clamped to the input voltage. Due to these characteristics, the proposed converter has the structure to minimize power losses. It is especially beneficial to the renewable energy conversion systems. To confirm the theoretical analysis and validity of the proposed converter, a 400 W prototype is implemented with the input voltage range from 40 to 80 V.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, three overmodulation techniques for the three-to-five-phase indirect matrix converter (IMC) are proposed. The first technique utilizes only the adjacent large vectors in the sector in which the reference output voltage vector lies. The second technique improves on that by continuously adapting vector elimination in the d_2{-}q_2 vector space based on the output voltage requirements. The third technique utilizes the ripple in the dc link to further reduce the modulation index of the inverter stage during overmodulation. All three techniques increase the voltage transfer ratio of the three-to-five-phase IMC from 0.788 to 0.923, but with the addition of harmonics generated by a vector in the d_2{-}q_2 vector space of the inverter stage. Simulation and experimental results from a prototype three-to-five-phase IMC validate the three proposed overmodulation techniques.},

  Abstract                 = {Linear permanent-magnet machines are often characterized by low inductance and short pole-pitch which leads to a small operational range of load angles. The resultant control performance using conventional direct thrust force control (DTFC) techniques is poor with high force ripple. This research improves this aspect of DTFC. A novel multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) state-space model, independent of the mover's speed, having stator flux and thrust force as states, is formulated for the linear permanent-magnet synchronous motor (PMSM). An optimal linear state feedback control scheme is then designed using the optimal linear quadratic regulator technique. Integral action is added to the designed control scheme by state augmentation to minimize the steady-state error and reduce the force ripple. Experimental results clearly prove that the proposed optimal control scheme results in a faster transient response of speed and force with improved steady-state regulation of force and flux when compared to the state of the art.},

By reviewing the high efficiency converters with CoolMOS and SiC-diodes, this paper improves a previous transformerless inverter circuit and presents related operating modes for reactive power generation. A novel pulse-width modulation (PWM) method for this improved inverter topology is then proposed for reactive power generation. The ground-loop voltage of this inverter under the proposed PWM method is also derived with common mode (CM) and differential mode (DM) circuit analyses, which indicate that high-frequency voltage components can be minimized with symmetrical design of inductors. A 250-W inverter hardware prototype has been designed and fabricated. Steady-state and transient operating conditions are tested to demonstrate the validity of the improved inverter and proposed PWM method for reactive power generation, and the high-frequency-free ground loop voltage.},

Therefore, it is unreasonable to ignore actuator nonlinearity to realize the excellent performances of the vibration isolation. In this paper, the problem of unknown actuator backlash in the vibration isolation system is investigated. To handle the lines-segments backlash nonlinearity, an adaptive smooth backlash inverse is employed to compensate the deleterious effect. Moreover, a promising controller is proposed to ensure that the motion of the moving platform converges to desired values. Based on Lyapunov's second method, all of the involved signals in the closed-loop system are proved to be stable. Finally, comparative studies involving active vibration isolation with actuator backlash are constructed and carried out to validate the effectiveness of the proposed control scheme.},

At first, the small-signal transfer functions of the voltage-regulation loop and the current balancing loop to the controller output are derived. The results show that the voltage-regulation loop and the proposed current-balancing loop are nominally decoupled. That is, two PI-type controllers can be designed independently and included to implement the proposed DCBC. Additionally, the single-sensor sampling-current strategy is proposed to obtain two average inductor currents by sensing only the sum of diode currents.

The former can be achieved by using an optimum power control strategy, which is quite a mutual technology right now. Meanwhile, the way to achieve the latter cannot be evidenced so far. It has been found out that the service life of WECS is closely related to the amount of dynamic loads it bears. In the research of this paper, three major dynamic loads, namely, aerodynamic load, transient load, and transit load, are studied. First, definitions and the generating mechanisms of different dynamic loads are given. Then, corresponding attenuating strategies are proposed, and their operational principles are elaborated. Finally, the proposed control strategies are combined into one low-dynamic load power control strategy, which is an improved version of the commonly used power control strategy for WECS in the industry. The load-attenuating effects are validated by applying comparative experimental tests performed by a 10-kW variable-speed fixed-pitch WECS test rig setup in the laboratory.},

This paper first reviews a number of widely used linear and nonlinear disturbance/uncertainty estimation techniques and then discusses and compares various compensation techniques and the procedures of integrating disturbance/uncertainty compensation with a (predesigned) linear/nonlinear controller. It also provides concise tutorials of the main methods in this area with clear descriptions of their features.

  Abstract                 = {A redundantly actuated parallel robot of the 6RSS mechanism involving two point-contact higher kinematic pairs (HKPs) has been developed for the evaluation of food texture changes during the process of mastication. To accomplish this, a fundamental capability of reproducing complex mandibular motions of human subjects in a biomimetic manner is required. In this paper, first, the mechanism and experimental setup of the robot are described, followed by five performance criteria proposed for the torque distribution across the robot. Second, the distributed torque is employed as a feedforward to enhance the independent joint control for the tracking of the mandibular movement. The frictional effects are compensated for to further improve the tracking accuracy. Finally, experiments are carried out to evaluate and compare the proposed control algorithms with the robot being commanded to reproduce a real human mandibular motion in free chewing, chewing a silicone gel, and chewing a wooden stick. The results illustrate that the robot is able to emulate complex mandibular motions, the distributed-torque-based joint control significantly enhances the motion tracking accuracy, and the friction compensation can further improve the motion tracking performance.},

The fault with some tiny magnitude (not larger than the magnitude of disturbances) is mainly considered for the nonlinear system subjected to model uncertainties, disturbances, and noises. The basic idea of our study is to use model-based method to decouple the possible disturbances and isolate faults, and then, appeal to computing intelligence to further reduce the influence of remaining model uncertainties. Specifically, the proposed approach is an extension of the observer-based method with artificial neural networks (ANNs) modeling technique to enhance the performance of the diagnosis system. With the decision logic considered, the small faults of actuators can be detected successfully. This method is applied to a satellite attitude control system and the effectiveness is shown.},

This paper provides some considerations for nonintrusive efficiency estimation of inverter-fed induction motors, focusing on the quantification of additional losses for different harmonic equivalent circuits and the effect of voltage and current harmonics on the performance of these motors. Based on the analysis of the existing efficiency estimation methods, recommended techniques are proposed for state-of-the-art methods. An application of such techniques is presented.

  Abstract                 = {Sinusoidal ripple-current (SRC) charging is a new charging technique that the sinusoidal current superposed with the direct current (dc) charges the battery at the frequency where the battery-alternating current (ac)-impedance reaches a minimum. However, in analyzing the effect on the SRC charging, the dc component of the SRC has not been considered until now. This paper presents a battery impedance analysis when the dc component is considered in the SRC charging. The real battery impedance is analyzed by using an electrical second-order RC battery model and overpotential voltage waveforms. The result shows that the real battery impedance is not minimized at the minimum-ac-impedance frequency. Due to this, in comparison with the constant current (CC)-constant voltage (CV) charging, the charging time, charging amount, and charging efficiency of the SRC-CV charging are not significantly different from those of the CC-CV charging. Rather, due to the ac component, the SRC-CV charging deteriorates the RMS current and maximum rising temperature by 22.5% and 18%, respectively. Also, this paper presents that the CC-CV charging using a slightly larger dc is more suitable for practical applications, since its current stress, charging time, and maximum rising temperature are improved by 2%, 9.7%, and 8.5%, respectively, in comparison with the SRC-CV charging.},

The overall superiority of dipole coils for a long-distance power delivery over loop coils with an identical configuration of a square core is verified by comparing the magnetizing inductance between primary and secondary coils. Series-parallel resonant circuits were used to achieve a higher load voltage than that of the series-series scheme. Contrary to conventional IPTSs or coupled magnetic resonance systems, the quality factor Q was set as low as 100, guaranteeing a frequency tolerance of 1%, where a prototype of narrow dipole coils with a length of 2 m was used to deliver 10.3 W of power up to 7 m away at a low frequency of 20 kHz. The powering capabilities of the proposed IPTS were experimentally compared inside and outside of a metal container 8 m Ã 4 m Ã 2.5 m in size at different frequencies ranging from 20 to 150 kHz, where the proposed IPTS is highly likely to be surrounded by arbitrary distributed conductors in most wireless sensor usage environments. The coupling coefficient Îº between the primary and secondary coils was measured over a long distance from 2 to 12 m for different secondary coil positions, where Îº is mostly much less than 0.01. A comparative analysis of the maximum amounts of load power among different core materials, i.e., two ferrite cores and an amorphous core, was conducted in relation to the design of a secondary coil. The results were verified by experiments at a given switching frequency of 20 kHz.},

It uses two dc-link voltage sensors to take care of the voltage differences and keeps it to a required tolerance level. A switching control strategy is developed using a space vector pulsewidth modulation scheme. The number of vectors per switching cycle is optimized to five, and changes in the control strategy depending on the two capacitor voltage differences are only allowed to take place at the start of each switching cycle. This helps in reducing the switching losses. A detailed analysis on the larger capacitor voltage deviation at high modulation index and leading power factor is analyzed, and four control strategies are developed to reduce it. Simulation studies are carried out in MATLAB/Simulink platform, and an experimental setup is developed using a DSpaceÂ®-based real-time emulator.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an innovative and effective linear current regulator for grid-connected converters interfaced by an LCL filter. The proposed scheme entails the use of voltages measured at the terminals of the output filter capacitors as feedforward signals to be included in a classical structure of proportional-resonant (PR) controller. Processing these signals by an opportune filter K(s), the resonance effects characterizing the LCL filter are neutralized and the impact of the grid impedance's variations on the converter's performances is greatly reduced. The proposed solution simplifies the controller's design, whose gains are obtained by a straightforward mathematical formula which prevents complex root locus analyses. Moreover, for a given phase margin, the proposed technique ensures the achievement of maximum possible bandwidth of closed-loop system, sidestepping the guesswork typical of the conventional methods used for selecting the crossover frequency. Conclusions are supported by a detailed mathematical analysis and validated by laboratory results obtained with a 7.5-kW three-phase inverter prototype connected to a power grid with time-variant impedance characteristics.},

  Abstract                 = {A three-axes portal-type computer numerical control (CNC) manipulator is analyzed, in this study. In order to improve the trajectory tracking ability of the manipulator for both linear and circular trajectories different controllers are examined. To compare the effectiveness of different control approaches on the improvement of tracking and contouring performance of the examined three-axes portal-type CNC, proportional-integral-derivative (PID), observer-based PID, and feedforward computed torque (FFCT) control approaches are applied. It is observed that not only overshoot in tracking and contour errors but also transient and steady-state errors are reduced using the proposed FFCT controller. Although computing time increases, the FFCT control method is found as the best solution for the considered cases to improve the trajectory tracking ability of the manipulator for both linear and circular trajectories.},

  Abstract                 = {State-of-health (SOH) assessment and remaining useful life (RUL) estimation are among the key issues in prognostics and health management (PHM) for electronic systems. Unlike mechanical systems, the homogeneity of the fault modes is quite low for electronic systems. Seen at the system level, there are also multiple and uncertain fault modes for electronic products. In this paper, we propose a novel methodology for system-level SOH assessment and RUL estimation inspired by the quantum mechanics disciplines, where there is no requirement to distinguish the fault modes from the fault development patterns. It is developed on the analogy that the healthy data points tend to move to the lower potential energy positions, and the subhealthy or unhealthy ones tend to be repelled from such positions. The fault development paths are located on the potential surface. The Fermi-Dirac health descriptor (FDHD) is defined based on the pseudowave function and potential function. Based on FDHD, the SOH assessment and RUL estimation algorithm are developed to track the existing fault development paths. Finally, the proposed method is verified in an experiment using power conversion board with a detailed analysis of the SOH assessment results and RUL estimation performances.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with embedded real-time (RT) simulators applied in power electronic applications and implemented in low-cost field-programmable gate arrays. Indeed, such simulators' intellectual properties (IPs) are not only intended for hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) testing but also can be advantageously embedded within digital controllers to ensure functions such as observation, estimation, diagnostic, or health monitoring. Conversely, to the HIL case, the main challenge when designing such simulators' IPs is to cope with their complexity having in mind that, in the case of embedded systems, the available hardware resources are limited due to the cost. Furthermore, this challenge is strengthened by the need of very short simulation time steps that is typically the case when simulating power converters. By this way, this paper presents the design of an embedded RT simulator of a three-phase grid-connected voltage-source rectifier, based on the associated discrete circuit modeling approach. This IP is associated with the one of a three-phase RL filter, and both are implemented within the rectifier controller to estimate the grid currents. The latter is injected in the controller when a fault is detected in the current sensors. The ability of this estimator to guarantee the service continuity in case of faults has been validated through HIL tests and experiments.},

With the introduction of an error transformation function, the constrained tracking control of the original vessel is transformed into the stabilization of an unconstrained system. A filtered tracking error is introduced based on the error transformation, and radial basis function (RBF) neural networks (NNs) are employed to approximate unknown vessel dynamics. Subsequently, stable adaptive NN control is proposed to ensure ultimate boundedness of all the signals in the closed-loop system and to guarantee prescribed tracking performances. Under persistent excitation (PE) condition, the proposed adaptive NN control is shown to be capable of acquiring knowledge on the vessel dynamics and of storing the learned knowledge in memory. The stored knowledge is reused to develop neural learning control such that the improved control performance with faster tracking convergence rate and less computational burden could be achieved, while prescribed transient and steady-state tracking control performances are guaranteed. Simulation studies are performed to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed design techniques.},

This paper proposes a novel BCM method based on âinstantaneous frequency of motor voltage.â Simulation and experimental results show that defective bearings cause to increase the amount of non-Gaussianity in this signal. In this paper, it is shown the global kurtosis of the proposed signal is able to detect bearing defects at an early stage. In contrast, for both vibration and current signals, it is preferable to applying the kurtosis locally in different frequency bands. The electrical signals are acquired from the motor terminals and motor control center of an oil pump station. Results approve the merits and effectiveness of the proposed method for industrial applications.},

The first one is designed to accurately estimate the stator inductances, whereas the second one is designed to precisely estimate the stator resistance, rotor flux linkage, and load torque. In this paper, the adaptive decoupling proportional-integral (PI) controllers with the maximum torque per ampere operation, which utilize the previously identified parameters in real time, are chosen to verify the effectiveness of the proposed parameter estimation scheme. The simulation results via MATLAB/Simulink and the experimental results via a prototype IPMSM drive system with a TI TMS320F28335 DSP are presented under various conditions. A comparative study with the conventional decoupling PI control method is carried out to demonstrate the better performances (i.e., faster dynamic response, less steady-state error, more robustness, etc.) of the adaptive decoupling PI control scheme based on the proposed online parameter estimation technique.},

Conventional cascade proportional-integral (derivative) [PI(D)] controllers are often used to control speed, torque, and current. However, for low-inertia machines, achieving a high-performance and wide speed range is far beyond the application conditions for which these controllers are designed for. Using two cascaded PI(D) controllers for the speed/current control of a low-inertia machine, changes in the speed set point should be slowly applied in order to avoid stability problems. In this paper, a model predictive control algorithm that is able to control the speed of a low-inertia brushless direct-current machine with a high bandwidth and good disturbance rejection properties is proposed. The algorithm is implemented on a SPARTAN 3E 1600 field-programmable gate-array board, and experimental results verify the performance of the proposed algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {A four-level five-phase open-end winding (OeW) drive topology is introduced in this paper. The drive comprises a five-phase induction machine with open-end stator windings, supplied using two two-level voltage-source inverters with isolated and unequal dc-link voltages, in the ratio 2â:â1. The topology offers the advantages of a modular structure with fewer semiconductor components and has a greater potential for fault tolerance, as compared with an equivalent single-sided four-level drive. Due to the large number of switching states, development of a suitable space vector pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) method can be challenging. Hence, this paper examines the implementation of two-level-shifted carrier-based PWM methods. The effect of dead time on the drive performance is discussed, and it is shown that simultaneous PWM switching of both inverters can lead to degraded output phase voltage waveforms. Detailed analysis of this phenomenon is presented, a solution is proposed, and the modified modulation techniques are incorporated in an experimental setup, at first in conjunction with V/f control. Once the proof of concept has been provided, full field-oriented control is implemented in this OeW drive topology for the first time; detailed experimental testing is conducted, and results are reported.},

  Abstract                 = {Renewable sources like solar photovoltaic (PV) and fuel cell stack are preferred to be operated at low voltages. For applications such as grid-tied systems, this necessitates high voltage boosting resulting in efficiency reduction. To handle this issue, this paper proposes a novel high voltage gain, high-efficiency dc-dc converter based on coupled inductor, intermediate capacitor, and leakage energy recovery scheme. The input energy acquired from the source is first stored in the magnetic field of coupled inductor and intermediate capacitor in a lossless manner. In subsequent stages, it is passed on to the output section for load consumption. A passive clamp network around the primary inductor ensures the recovery of energy trapped in the leakage inductance, leading to drastic improvement in the voltage gain and efficiency of the system. Exorbitant duty cycle values are not required for high voltage gain, which prevents problems such as diode reverse recovery. Presence of a passive clamp network causes reduced voltage stress on the switch. This enables the use of low voltage rating switch (with low âon-stateâ resistance), improving the overall efficiency of the system. Analytical details of the proposed converter and its hardware results are included.},

  Abstract                 = {One of the main technical challenges associated with the modular multilevel converter (MMC) for any application is the optimal control of its states. Optimal control of the MMC requires determination of the following: 1) an accurate MMC model, 2) the MMC states to be controlled and their corresponding reference trajectories, and 3) an appropriate controller type/form and its parameters. The aforementioned tasks lead to the formulation of a multistate control optimization problem, which is tackled in this paper. This paper enhances the accuracy of the existing MMC state-space model by including the following: 1) a piecewise affine insulated-gate bipolar transistor/diode model and 2) the impact of dead time. This paper also proposes a simulation-based gradient-descent optimization algorithm (cosimulation) to optimize the controller gains, given the controller type/form and the reference state trajectory. The theoretical proofs of the gradients required in the optimization algorithm are also provided. The aforementioned optimization algorithm is applied to a variable-frequency MMC-based drive system. Experimental results on a scaled-down prototype and simulation results on a real-world application are provided to validate the accuracy of the proposed MMC model and to show the effectiveness of the proposed optimization algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Arm voltage and submodule (SM) capacitor voltage balancing is a key factor for the safe and reliable operation of modular multilevel converters (MMCs). The arm voltage balancing is achieved through a zero-sequence voltage controller in carrier pulse-width modulation (CPWM). In this study, a dual space-vector pulse-width modulation (SVPWM) technique is proposed for an MMC, which eliminates the external controller for arm voltage balancing. In this approach, the three-phase top and bottom arms are independently controlled using SVPWM. In addition, the capacitor voltage balancing can be achieved using redundant switching vectors. However, this will increase the computational load on the space-vector modulator. Therefore, an external capacitor voltage-balancing approach is proposed to minimize the computational complexity. The proposed approach uses the direction of load current instead of the arm current in SM selection process. As such, the required number of current sensors is reduced to 50% in a three-phase system. The proposed modulation and voltage-balancing approach are simulated and experimentally verified on the MMC system with three-level flying capacitor (3L-FC) SMs. Simulation and experimental results show the successful balancing of the arm voltage and SM capacitors voltage.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to achieve the highest efficiency of wireless power transfer (WPT) systems, the quality factor of the resonant coil should be as high as possible. Due to the skin effect and the proximity effect, the coil resistance increases with the increase in the frequency. The highest quality factor exists for the optimal frequency together with the corresponding frequency-dependent inductor resistance. This paper employs the Biot-Savart law to calculate the magnetic field strength, which results in the proximity-effect resistance in single-layer litz-wire square solenoid coils without a magnetic core. A strand-number coefficient is introduced to reflect the influence of the strand number inside the wire bundle on the proximity-effect resistance. The coefficient is obtained through simple inductor resistance measurements for various numbers of litz-wire strands. The optimal frequency for the highest quality factor is derived based on the resistance evaluation. Several prototype coils were manufactured to verify the resistance analysis. Two 50 cm Ã 50 cm square coils were employed to construct a WPT prototype. The maximum dc-dc efficiency of this WPT was about 75% at 100-cm distance.},

Smooth or p-times differentiable step functions are next introduced to ensure that the collision avoidance is only active when the ships are in their collision detection zones. For each ship, a dynamical variable is introduced to deal with relaxation of the reference path generation and difficulties caused by underactuation.

  Abstract                 = {The need to deal with rapid change in an environmentally and economically friendly manner has led to renewed interest in data-driven, online process optimization. Although various methods, such as economic model predictive control (EMPC), are available to achieve this goal, they require that the process model be available and relatively accurate and that there be no process changes. Recently, the focus has shifted to using economic key performance indices (KPIs) to design supervisory controllers to regulate the process. In order to accomplish this, accurate models of the highly nonlinear KPIs are needed. A solution to this problem is to develop a two-step control strategy consisting of a static, offline component and a dynamic, online component. This paper proposes the use of a linear, BILIMOD method combined with a self-partitioning algorithm for the static component and gradient-based optimization method for the dynamic component. In order to deal with process changes, the static model parameters are updated. The proposed new controller strategy is tested on the wastewater treatment process. It is shown that the proposed method can quickly and effectively achieve the desired optimal point with minimal disturbance to the overall process.},

  Abstract                 = {Surface electromyogram (sEMG) signals can be applied in medical, rehabilitation, robotic, and industrial fields. As a typical application, a myoelectric prosthetic hand is controlled by the sEMG signals of the amputee's residual muscles. To improve the dexterity of the myoelectric prosthetic hand, additional hand motion commands need to be classified. The more sEMG sensors are used, the more hand motion commands can be classified. However, the amputee's residual muscles are limited. In order to improve the practicability of the myoelectric prosthetic hand, it is critical to investigate the effective pattern recognition algorithms to deal with the sEMG signals detected by fewer sensors, while identifying as many hand motion commands as possible. Current pattern recognition algorithms for sEMG signals are challenged by limited recognition patterns and unsteady classification accuracy rates. To solve these dilemmas, we employed discrete wavelet transform (DWT) and wavelet neural network (WNN) algorithms to improve the pattern recognition effects of sEMG signals. In addition, the back propagation and gradient descent algorithms were utilized to train WNN. In this work, we only used three sEMG sensors to classify and recognize six kinds of hand motion commands. The maximum identification accuracy rate is 100%, and an average classification accuracy rate of the proposed WNN is 94.67%, which is substantially better than the artificial neural network (ANN) algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiphase drives and parallel converters have been recently proposed in low-voltage high-power applications. The fault-tolerant capability provided by multiphase drives is then extended with parallel converters, increasing their suitability for safety-critical and renewable uses. This advantageous feature, compared with standard three-phase drives, has been analyzed in the event of open-phase faults. However, when using parallel converters, a converter fault does not necessarily imply an open-phase condition, but usually just a limited phase current capability. This paper analyzes the fault-tolerant capability of six-phase drives with parallel converter supply. Different scenarios considering up to three faults for single and two neutral configurations are examined, optimizing offline the postfault currents and modifying accordingly the control strategies. Experimental results confirm the smooth transition from prefault to postfault situation and the enhanced postfault torque capability.},

  Abstract                 = {The most recent literature on multiphase machine drives is based on voltage-source converter (VSC) systems utilizing different modulation techniques. Very little attention is given to the multiphase current-source converters (CSCs). Applying CSCs in high-power multiphase drive systems is promising and can effectively solve many technical problems associated with conventional VSC-based systems. This paper proposes a space vector pulsewidth-modulation (SVPWM) scheme suitable for a five-phase CSC. Generally, in SVPWM-CSCs, a current path should be provided for the dc-link current by ensuring that one pair of upper and lower switches is always on. Applying this constraint yields 25 different space vectors, which are mapped into two concentric decagons with ten equal sectors in the \alpha \beta and xy sequence planes. Each sector has two active-large vectors, two active-small vectors, and a null vector. Moreover, the active-large vectors in the \alpha \beta plane are active-small vectors in the xy plane, and vice versa. In the proposed scheme, the ampere-second concept is utilized to determine the ratio between the dwelling times of the large and small vectors such that the xy current components are nullified, the utilization of the input dc-current is maximized, and the switching transitions are minimized, which, in turn, minimizes the CSC switching losses. The proposed scheme can effectively provide sinusoidal converter currents, which is suitable for motor drives and energy conversion applications. The proposed scheme is verified using a 1-kW prototype five-phase induction motor fed by a five-phas- CSC.},

Compared with the conventional high-boost ZSI topologies, the proposed inverter uses shorter shoot-through duration and a larger modulation index to improve the output waveform quality. Comparison between the proposed topology and previously proposed schemes, in terms of inductor numbers, voltage and current stresses on elements, sizes of inductors and capacitors, efficiency, and switching device product (SDP) factors of diodes, is made, and the results verify the priority of the proposed topology.

Accordingly, this paper aims to develop an effective fault estimation technique to simultaneously estimate the system states and the concerned faults, while minimizing the influences from process/sensor disturbances. Specifically, an augmented system is constructed by forming an augmented state vector composed of the system states and the concerned faults. Next, an unknown input observer (UIO) is designed for the augmented system by decoupling the partial disturbances and attenuating the disturbances that cannot be decoupled, leading to a simultaneous estimate of the system states and the concerned faults. In order to be close to the practical engineering situations, the process disturbances in this study are assumed not to be completely decoupled. In the first part of this paper, the existence condition of such an UIO is proposed to facilitate the fault estimation for linear systems subjected to process disturbances. In the second part, robust fault estimation techniques are addressed for Lipschitz nonlinear systems subjected to both process and sensor disturbances. The proposed technique is finally illustrated by the simulation studies of a three-shaft gas turbine engine and a single-link flexible joint robot.},

  Abstract                 = {In high-end motion control systems, the real-time computational platform must execute tasks from multiple control loops operating at high sampling rates. In recent years, traditional special-purpose platforms have been replaced by general-purpose multiprocessor platforms, which introduce significant fluctuations in execution times. While considering worst-case execution times would severely reduce the sampling rates, accepting deadline misses and assuring that the control system still meets the desired specifications is challenging. In this paper, we provide a framework to model and assert the impact of deadline misses in a real-time control loop. We consider stochastic models for deadline misses and characterize the mean and the variance of closed-loop output variables based on a time-domain analysis. We illustrate the usefulness of our framework in the control of a benchmark motion control experimental setup and in the control of a wafer stage in a lithographic machine.},

  Abstract                 = {In an electric drive vehicle (EDV), the available voltage on a dc-link is limited, and so the inverter output voltage and, consequently, the line motor maximum speed are limited. The fundamental voltage of the inverter output is increased approximately 27% using a square wave (SW) switching pattern instead of a sine wave switching pattern. However, this pattern can only be used at high speeds, and at lower speeds a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) pattern should be used. In order to achieve proper control, the switching pattern should be changed seamlessly. In the present paper, a new PWM scheme for single-mode seamless control of Vernier motors is proposed. In the proposed scheme, the reference voltage is modified to change the switching pattern continuously so that the voltage changes smoothly from a high-frequency pattern to an SW and voltage discontinuity does not occur. Experimental results reveal that the inverter-switching pattern changes smoothly from a sinusoidal PWM pattern to an SW pattern, and so seamless control from the constant-torque region to the constant-power region, and vice versa, is achieved. Since the proposed scheme is a single-mode control, it is much simpler than current technologies, which are based on multimode controllers. Also the proposed method has a lower total harmonic disturbance (THD) as well as a lower harmonic distortion factor (HDF) compared to some existing methods.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a resilient framework for fault-tolerant operation in modular multilevel converters (MMCs) to facilitate normal operation under internal and external fault conditions. This framework is realized by designing and implementing a supervisory algorithm and a postfault restoration scheme. The supervisory algorithm includes monitoring and decision-making units to detect and identify faults by analyzing the circulating current and submodule capacitor voltages in a very short time. The postfault restoration scheme is proposed to immediately replace the faulty submodule with the redundant healthy one. The restoration is achieved by virtue of a multilevel modular capacitor-clamped dc/dc converter (MMCCC), which is redundantly aggregated to each arm of the MMC. This design effectively guarantees smooth mode transition and handles the failure of multiple submodules in a short time interval. In addition, a modified modulation scheme is presented to ensure submodule capacitor voltage balancing of the MMC without implementing any additional hardware. Fast fault identification, a fully modular structure, and robust postfault restoration are the main features of the proposed framework. Digital time-domain simulation studies are conducted on a 21-level MMC to confirm the effectiveness and resilience of the proposed fault-tolerant framework during internal and external faults. Furthermore, the proposed framework is implemented in the FPGA-based RT-LAB real-time simulator platform to validate its resilience in a hardware-in-the-loop setup.},

The communication channel is described by means of a multipath representation while the different noise contributions, supported by a dedicated measurement campaign, include impulsive and very low-frequency disturbances. The channel emulator is designed on a Virtex-6 FPGA with a target working frequency of 200 MHz.

  Abstract                 = {One of the most attractive features of multiphase machines is the fault-tolerant capability due to the higher number of phases. Different postfault control strategies based on hysteresis, proportional integral (PI)-resonant, and predictive techniques have been recently proposed. They all proved their capabilities to withstand fault situations and to preserve the fundamental component of the air-gap field, while achieving minimum losses, maximum torque per ampere, and reducing torque vibrations. Nonetheless, due to their recent introduction, no thorough study has yet appeared comparing the performance of these controllers. In this paper, two open-phase fault-tolerant control schemes are experimentally compared in a real five-phase induction machine. The controllers being compared are based on PI-resonant and predictive control techniques, respectively. The experiments include pre- and postfault situations. Obtained results show that both control methods offer nearly the same performance. When compared, predictive control provides faster control response and superior performance at low-speed operation but is found to be less resilient to fault detection delays and to have higher current ripple. Regarding the controller implementation, it is shown that the transition from prefault to postfault operation involves modeling the nonlinear effects observed when an open-phase fault occurs for the predictive controller and proper retuning of the PI trackers for the PI-resonant controller, to ensure postfault operation.},

The measurements are often subject to varying levels of noise and the resulting optimization can have numerous local minima that exhibit high sensitivity in the choice of optimization parameters. As a first contribution, we present a fast and numerically robust local optimization algorithm for the two-frame sensor calibration objective function. Using coordinate-invariant differential geometric methods that take into account the matrix Lie group structure of the rigid-body transformations, our local descent method makes use of analytic gradients and Hessians, and a strictly descending fast step-size estimate to achieve significant performance improvements. As a second contribution, we present a two-phase stochastic geometric optimization algorithm for finding a stochastic global minimizer based on our earlier local optimizer. Numerical studies demonstrate the considerably enhanced robustness and efficiency of our algorithm over existing unit quaternion-based methods.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates possible reduction of pulsating torque in open-loop and vector-controlled induction motor drives through deployment of certain advanced bus-clamping pulsewidth modulation (ABCPWM) method. Toward this goal, a simple and machine-independent method is proposed to analyze the torque harmonic spectrum of a voltage source inverter fed induction motor, operated with any real-time pulsewidth modulation (PWM) method. The analytically evaluated torque harmonic spectra, pertaining to conventional space vector PWM (CSVPWM), bus-clamping PWM (BCPWM), and ABCPWM, are validated through simulation and experimental results. Theoretical and experimental studies bring out the superiority of the ABCPWM in terms of torque harmonics over CSVPWM and BCPWM. The magnitude of the dominant torque harmonic with the ABCPWM scheme is shown to be significantly lower than that with CSVPWM, over a wide range of speed. The rms torque ripple (i.e., total rms value of all harmonic torques) is lower with ABCPWM than with BCPWM over the entire range of speed.},

Evaluation of the dc-link capacitors in terms of power loss, ageing, and failure rate will play an important role in design stages of the next-generation power converters. This paper proposes a new evaluation circuit for dc-link capacitors used in a high-power three-phase inverter, which is intended for testing power loss, failure rate, ageing, and so on. The evaluation circuit produces a practical ripple current waveform and a dc bias voltage into a capacitor under test, in which the ripple current is equivalent to that generated by the three-phase inverter on the dc link. The evaluation circuit employs a full-scale current-rating and downscaled voltage-rating inverter for producing the ripple current, so that the power rating of the evaluation circuit is much smaller than that of a full-scale current-rating and full-scale voltage-rating inverter. Theoretical analysis and simulated results verify the effectiveness of new evaluation circuit.},

This paper examines and extends several discrete-time variants of active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), which is increasingly being applied especially in the field of power electronics and drives, in this regard. Detailed guidelines for practical ADRC implementations with these abilities are presented, and all features are being demonstrated with the help of simulation examples.},

As a part of their experimental section, the control-to-output frequency response is compared against the models of Ridley and Kondrath. The comparison reveals a significant difference between Ridleyâs model and the proposed model as well as the measured frequency response. If this were true, controller designs relying on Ridleyâs model would possibly have to be called into question, presumably affecting many practical designs. For this reason, the model comparison will be repeated here, showing that the results of Ridleyâs model are in fact very close to the proposed model of Smithson and Williamson if the correct model formulation is being used.},

In this paper, the impact of electrothermal variations (gate and thermal resistance) between parallel-connected devices on module robustness is investigated for 900-V-CoolMOS and 1.2-kV-SiC MOSFETs under clamped inductive switching (CIS) and unclamped inductive switching (UIS). Under CIS, the difference in the steady-state junction temperature (ÎTJ) and switching energy (ÎESW) between the parallel-connected devices for a given difference in the gate and thermal resistance (ÎRG and ÎRTH) is used as the metric for determining robustness to electrothermal variations, i.e., how well the devices maintain uniform temperature inspite of switching with different rates and thermal resistances. Under UIS conditions, the change in the maximum avalanche current/energy prior to device failure as a function of the ÎTJ and ÎRG between the parallel-connected devices is used as the metric. Under both CIS and UIS, SiC devices show better performance with minimal negative response to electrothermal variations between the parallel-connected devices. Finite-element models have also been performed showing the dynamics of BJT latch-up during UIS for different technologies.},

This paper is concerned with machine-learning-enabled battery state-of-health (SOH) indication and prognosis. The sample entropy of short voltage sequence is used as an effective signature of capacity loss. Advanced sparse Bayesian predictive modeling (SBPM) methodology is employed to capture the underlying correspondence between the capacity loss and sample entropy. The SBPM-based SOH monitor is compared with a polynomial model developed in our prior work. The proposed approach allows for an analytical integration of temperature effects such that an explicitly temperature-perspective SOH estimator is established, whose performance and complexity is contrasted to the support vector machine (SVM) scheme. The forecast of remaining useful life is also performed via a combination of SBPM and bootstrap sampling concepts. Large amounts of experimental data from multiple lithium-ion battery cells at three different temperatures are deployed for model construction, verification, and comparison. Such a multi-cell setting is more useful and valuable than only considering a single cell (a common scenario). This is the first known application of combined sample entropy and SBPM to battery health prognosis.},

This paper presents an isolated ultra-high step-up dc-dc converter in matrix transformer configuration. A flyback-forward converter is adopted as the power cell and the secondary side matrix connection is introduced to increase the power level and to improve fault tolerance. Because of the modular structure of the converter, the stress on the switching devices is decreased and so is the transformer size. The proposed topology can be operated in column interleaved modes, row interleaved modes, and hybrid working modes in order to deal with the varying energy from the wind farm. Furthermore, fault-tolerant operation is also realized in several fault scenarios. A 400-W dc-dc converter with four cells is developed and experimentally tested to validate the proposed technique, which can be applied to high-power high-voltage dc power transmission.},

  Abstract                 = {The half-teeth-wound switched reluctance machines (HT-SRMs) having single-layer concentrated windings, feature simpler structures since the coil number is half, and phase-to-phase insulations in slot are eliminated. To evaluate the effects of winding configurations, the electromagnetic performances of HT-SRMs and conventional full-teeth-wound SRMs (FT-SRMs), including air-gap flux density, coil and phase flux linkage, inductance, torque, volt-ampere, and radial magnetic force (RMF), are comprehensively compared. The results based on theoretical analysis and finite-element (FE) method reveal that HT-SRMs would exhibit higher torque per ampere when the magnetic saturations are not too severe, whereas require higher voltage supply and generate more significant RMF. Further, it is found that the fault-tolerant capabilities of HT-SRMs are superior to FT-SRMs. A pair of prototypes with identical laminations but different winding configurations are manufactured and the experimental results confirm the predictions.},

This strategy is the first of its kind for planar motors, and it is used to generate the desired thrust force with the minimum sum of squares of the three-phase current. To formulate this strategy, a constrained optimization problem with time-varying parameters is first developed. Then, the problem is transformed into an unconstrained problem with a barrier function. Additionally, a self-designed adaptive genetic algorithm is introduced to solve the unconstrained optimization problem for locating the optimal currents. Comparative studies of the proposed and conventional strategies for a PSRM system are carried out via simulation and experiment, and planar trajectory tracking for the system with the proposed strategy is experimentally performed.

The influence of the stator core temperature on rotor thermal performance is analyzed by using a coupling simulation of fluid-temperature field. The temperature rise measurement of rotor is employed to study the impact of different cooling way on rotor thermal performance and to verify the computational accuracy of losses and temperature distribution. The analysis result of air-friction loss is compared with the measurement, which is obtained from the total losses by using the method of loss separation.

  Abstract                 = {The temperature and dV/dt dependence of crosstalk has been analyzed for Si-IGBT and SiC-MOSFET power modules. Due to a smaller Miller capacitance resulting from a smaller die area, the SiC module exhibits smaller shoot-through currents compared with similarly rated Si-IGBT modules in spite of switching with a higher dV/dt and with a lower threshold voltage. However, due to high voltage overshoots and ringing from the SiC Schottky diode, SiC modules exhibit higher shoot-through energy density and induce voltage oscillations in the dc link. Measurements show that the shoot-through current exhibits a positive temperature coefficient for both technologies, the magnitude of which is higher for the Si-IGBT, i.e., the shoot-through current and energy show better temperature stability in the SiC power module. The effectiveness of common techniques of mitigating shoot-through, including bipolar gate drives, multiple gate resistance switching paths, and external gate-source and snubber capacitors, has been evaluated for both technologies at different temperatures and switching rates. The results show that solutions are less effective for SiC-MOSFETs because of lower threshold voltages and smaller margins for negative gate bias on the SiC-MOSFET gate. Models for evaluating the parasitic voltage have also been developed for diagnostic and predictive purposes. These results are important for converter designers seeking to use SiC technology.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a single-stage solution for solar photovoltaic (PV) pumping system using a dual-inverter fed open-end winding induction motor drive is presented. The three-level dual-inverter requires a low PV bus voltage compared with its conventional three-level counterpart. This could avoid large string of PV modules and helps in reducing the voltage rating of the capacitors and semiconductor devices used in the system. This may further help in reduction of cost of the system. The proposed single-stage system is operated using an integrated control algorithm, which includes the maximum power point tracking (MPPT), the V/f control, and the sample-averaged zero-sequence elimination (SAZE) pulsewidth modulation (PWM) technique. While the MPPT algorithm ensures the extraction of maximum power from the PV source, the V/f control improves the motor pump performance. Furthermore, the zero-sequence current is avoided by the SAZE PWM algorithm. Thus, the integrated control algorithm improves the overall performance of the system. Furthermore, this paper also presents the details of system design and analysis of its dynamic behavior during transient environmental conditions. The performance of the system is verified using MATLAB simulation and hardware prototype.},

  Abstract                 = {Multivariate statistical process monitoring involves dimension reduction and latent feature extraction in large-scale processes and typically incorporates all measured variables. However, involving variables without beneficial information may degrade monitoring performance. This study analyzes the effect of variable selection on principal component analysis (PCA) monitoring performance. Then, it proposes a fault-relevant variable selection and Bayesian inference-based distributed method for efficient fault detection and isolation. First, the optimal subset of variables is identified for each fault using an optimization algorithm. Second, a sub-PCA model is established in each subset. Finally, the monitoring results of all of the subsets are combined through Bayesian inference. The proposed method reduces redundancy and complexity, explores numerous local behaviors, and provides accurate description of faults, thus improving monitoring performance significantly. Case studies on a numerical example, the Tennessee Eastman benchmark process, and an industrial-scale plant demonstrate the efficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {The issue of quality-related fault detection has attracted much attention in recent years. Partial least squares (PLS) is considered as an efficient tool for predicting and monitoring. However, due to the fact that PLS performs an oblique projection to input space, it is not suitable for quality-related fault detection. On the other hand, PLS is a static method which cannot be used in dynamic systems. In this paper, a dynamic least squares approach is developed by using the structure of auto-regressive moving average exogenous (ARMAX) time-series model. Furthermore, augmented input matrix is decomposed into two orthogonal parts according to their correlations with output, such that quality-related fault detection can be utilized by designing appropriate statistics in two subspaces corresponding to the two parts. The proposed approached is simple and effective for systems with dynamic input and static output, which is a common case for most industrial processes. A numerical example and an industrial process simulator are applied to test the performance of the proposed approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Wound-field synchronous generators are widely used in aircraft and marine electrical systems. As the electric power requirements increase, there is renewed interest in dc power networks, but the electrical source remains a synchronous generator. The combination of a diode rectifier with a wound-field multiphase generator reduces the voltage ripple on the dc network and increases fault tolerance, compared with an equivalent three-phase system. It also increases the options in terms of the winding design and configuration. This paper uses circuit modeling, including harmonics, informed by static finite-element results, to understand the wound-field generator performance for star and polygon connections of both short- and fully-pitched coils. Experimental results are used to validate the models. A polygon connection of short-pitched coils is shown to give good generator utilization for a healthy machine. However, careful design is required to prevent circulating harmonic currents. Under winding open-circuit faults, the polygon connection requires significant derating, making the star connection the preferred option.},

  Abstract                 = {Multilevel inverters with dodecagonal (12-sided polygon) voltage space vector (SV) structures have advantages like extension of linear modulation range, elimination of fifth and seventh harmonics in phase voltages and currents for the full modulation range including extreme 12-step operation, reduced device voltage ratings, lesser dv/dt stresses on devices and motor phase windings resulting in lower EMI/EMC problems, and lower switching frequency-making it more suitable for high-power drive applications. This paper proposes a simple method to obtain pulsewidth modulation (PWM) timings for a dodecagonal voltage SV structure using only sampled reference voltages. In addition to this, a carrier-based method for obtaining the PWM timings for a general N-level dodecagonal structure is proposed in this paper for the first time. The algorithm outputs the triangle information and the PWM timing values which can be set as the compare values for any carrier-based hardware PWM module to obtain SV PWM like switching sequences. The proposed method eliminates the need for angle estimation, computation of modulation indices, and iterative search algorithms that are typical in multilevel dodecagonal SV systems. The proposed PWM scheme was implemented on a five-level dodecagonal SV structure. Exhaustive simulation and experimental results for steady-state and transient conditions are presented to validate the proposed method.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, distributed formation control laws for the multi-agent systems are proposed when the leader is moving constantly with unknown velocity. The proposed control laws are based on the distance-based formation control; therefore, each distance between agents is controlled measuring the relative position. Because the control laws use only local information such as relative position with respect to their own local reference frame, the control laws are completely decentralized. The proposed control laws are designed to make a group of agents keep the desired formation and move with a constant reference velocity in two-dimensional space. The considered system consists of three types of agents: 1) leader; 2) first follower; and 3) follower. The leader knows the reference velocity value, whereas the other agents do not know the reference velocity. For this reason, the first follower and follower estimate the reference velocity by using the adaptive method. Using graph theory and nonlinear control theory, the control laws are verified mathematically. Additionally, the three-agent case is extended to $N$-agent case by an inductive way. The stability and convergence of the system are theoretically analyzed, and the validity of the proposed control laws is clarified by performing simulations and real experiments.},

The proposed converters have no commutation problem even if all of the switches are turned on or off simultaneously. They do not use lossy snubbers and do not sense the voltage polarity for commutation, and produce high-quality output voltage waveforms. The proposed converters allow the use of power MOSFETs and fast recovery freewheeling diodes independently. The use of power MOSFETs as active switches and freewheeling diodes with extremely fast recovery features lower the switching losses and enable us to reduce the volume of passive components by increasing switching frequency. The input (or output) filter inductor experiences twice of the converter switching frequency and thus can be designed with minimum size. To increase power density of the proposed converters, a three-phase three-limb coupled inductor is proposed. Three-phase coupled inductor integrates three separate coupled inductors of the proposed converters in one three-limb core. In comparison with separate coupled inductors, the three-phase coupled inductor has a smaller size with large current-handling capability.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an enhanced time-delay controller (TDC) for the position control of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) under disturbances. A conventional TDC performs well when the involved data acquisition rate is fast. However, in AUV control applications that use a Doppler velocity log (DVL) navigation system, we cannot keep the data acquisition rate sufficiently fast because a DVL sensor generally supplies data at a slow acquisition rate, which degrades the performance of the TDC. To overcome this problem, we propose an integral sliding-mode controller to be supplemented to the conventional TDC to improve the control precision even if the DVL navigation system is in operation. The proposed controller is computationally simple and robust to unmodeled dynamics and disturbances. We performed computer simulations and experiments with the Cyclops AUV to demonstrate the validity of the proposed controller.},

  Abstract                 = {In a multiple-receiver wireless power transfer (WPT) system, determining the condition for uniform power distribution at a high transfer efficiency is a challenging issue. In this paper, a selective WPT technique using magnetic resonance coupling (MRC) is introduced for smart power delivery in a multiple-receiver system. The proposed method selectively and exclusively delivers power to only one designated receiver among multiple receivers, eliminating the cross-coupling effect and unbalanced power division problem across the receivers. This is achieved by separating the resonant frequencies of the receivers to isolate the coupling effects between coils. The power division ratio of the receivers is controlled by changing the duration time ratio for power transfer. In this paper, a one-transmitter three-receiver selective MRC system is designed and fabricated. The power distribution is demonstrated under impedance matched condition, showing a power transfer efficiency of 24%-29% at a very small coupling coefficient of 0.01 with a 12-mm-diameter receiver coil. Distance compensation and a one-way communication of time division multiple access are demonstrated for a multiple-receiver system, using the proposed method.},

  Abstract                 = {Permanent-magnet motors with rare-earth magnets are among the best candidates for high-performance applications such as automotive applications. However, due to their cost and risks relating to the security of supply, alternative solutions such as ferrite magnets have recently become popular. In this paper, the two major design challenges of using ferrite magnets for a high-torque-density and high-speed application, i.e., their low remanent flux density and low coercivity, are addressed. It is shown that a spoke-type design utilizing a distributed winding may overcome the torque density challenge due to a simultaneous flux concentration and a reluctance torque possibility. Furthermore, the demagnetization challenge can be overcome through the careful optimization of the rotor structure, with the inclusion of nonmagnetic voids on the top and bottom of the magnets. To meet the challenges of a high-speed operation, an extensive rotor structural analysis has been undertaken, during which electromagnetics and manufacturing tolerances are taken into account. Electromagnetic studies are validated through the testing of a prototype, which is custom built for static torque and demagnetization evaluation. The disclosed motor design surpasses the state-of-the-art performance and cost, merging the theories into a multidisciplinary product.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the maximum power tracking of a pneumatically driven electric generator in a standalone small-scale compressed air energy storage system. In this system, an air motor is used to drive a permanent-magnet direct-current generator, whose output is controlled by a buck converter supplying power to a resistive load. The output power of the converter is controlled such that the air motor operates at a speed corresponding to the maximum power. A maximum power point (MPP) tracking controller employs a hybrid perturb and observe method. The rate of change of the converter's output power with respect to its duty cycle and the change of the power and the duty cycle are used to correct the search direction under transient input power fluctuations. Small speed step changes are used in the vicinity of the MPP to improve the accuracy of the search algorithm. However, relatively coarse speed step changes are used when the operating point is far from the MPP to improve the dynamic response of the controller and to increase its speed of convergence. The analysis and design of the controller are based on a small injected-absorbed current signal model of the power converter. The controller is experimentally implemented using a real-time digital signal processor system. Test results are presented to validate the proposed design and to demonstrate its capabilities.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a new control strategy based on Lyapunov-function and proportional-resonant (PR) controller for single-phase grid-connected LCL-filtered voltage-source inverters (VSIs). While Lyapunov-function-based control guarantees the global stability of the system, the PR controller is employed to process the grid current error and determine the inverter current reference. However, it is shown that the conventional Lyapunov-function-based control (CLFBC) together with the PR control cannot damp the inherent resonance of the LCL filter. Therefore, this control approach is modified by adding a capacitor voltage loop so as to achieve the desired resonance damping. In addition, a transfer function from the reference grid current to actual grid current is formulated in terms of the LCL-filter parameters and their possible variations in the proposed control strategy. An important consequence of using the PR controller is that the need for performing first and second derivative operations in the generation of inverter current reference is eliminated. Also, a zero steady-state error in the grid current is guaranteed in the case of variations in the LCL-filter parameters. The computer simulations and experimental results obtained from a 3.3-kW system show that the proposed control strategy exhibits a good performance in achieving the required control objectives such as fast dynamic response, zero steady-state error, global stability, and sinusoidal grid current with low total harmonic distortion (THD).},

In addition, a double-band hysteresis scheme which ensures the switching of a transistor in the VSI during a half cycle while it remains either on or off in the other half cycle of the fundamental period is used to mitigate the switching frequency. Furthermore, the analytical expressions for the instantaneous and average switching frequencies are derived. The theoretical considerations and analytical results are verified through computer simulations and experimental results obtained from a 3.3-kW system.

Generally, the third-harmonic current is utilized for the air-gap flux density optimization in a five-phase motor. However, the method has a negative effect on the yoke flux density, and the yoke iron width should be increased. Alternatively, this problem can be solved by providing more control freedom degrees of the motor with a phase number greater than five. A nine-phase motor is employed to achieve the air-gap and yoke flux density distribution optimization simultaneously. Moreover, the performance of both motors is compared in the sinusoidal and nonsinusoidal power supply modes. The analysis of the torque density and the efficiency demonstrates that a nonsinusoidal power supply is more suitable for a heavy-load operation.

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a generic control scheme for automatic resonant frequency tracking (ARFT) in resonant converters. The plant is modeled based on realistic ramp variation of resonant frequency due to slowly varying environmental conditions. The proposed ARFT scheme monitors the gain relationship between an exclusive electrical variable pair to detect frequency drift. An analytical approach is presented to select the most suitable variable pair for gain comparison. The effects of tank parameter variation and circuit nonidealities on the gain relationship of the chosen variable pair have been analyzed. An online correction mechanism is proposed to nullify the influence of load variation on the proposed technique. Second-order generalized integrator-based low-cost analog realization of the proposed strategy is detailed. Analytical predictions are experimentally validated by applying the control scheme to a parallel LLC tank-based resonant dc-dc converter.},

As the holding force becomes larger, so does the current capacity of the circuit breaker. Producing a large holding force with the same PMA size is therefore important in PMA design. This paper presents a design method of a PMA for VCBs. To attain the desired holding force under the restriction of the PMA size, most of the influential PMA yoke design parameters were obtained by the Taguchi method. PMA dynamic characteristics were simulated considering the electromagnetic characteristics, the PMA driving circuit, and the mechanical components connected to the PMA output shaft. Experiments were performed to validate the proposed design method, and the experimental results were compared with the simulation results.},

  Abstract                 = {The Vienna rectifier, which is a nongenerative-boost type rectifier, is used in many applications such as telecommunication systems and wind turbine systems. The Vienna rectifier has a special operating requirement. Many switching methods considering this requirement were proposed. These methods generally take into account the Vienna rectifier's operation with the unity power factor because the Vienna rectifier aims to provide the power to the load. However, as the applications for the Vienna rectifier are diversified, control requirements have been suggested, including the dc-link voltage balance control and the novel control under severely unbalanced grids. In this paper, we propose a carrier-based pulse-width modulation (CB-PWM) method for Vienna rectifier operation with a variable power factor. The proposed CB-PWM method adds the compensation voltage to the three-phase reference voltages, depending on the power factor, to maintain the sinusoidal input currents of the Vienna rectifier. The performance and effectiveness of the proposed CB-PWM method are verified by simulation and experiment.},

Conventional controller results in poor control performance due to the effect of the right-half-plane zero in CCM operation. To achieve accurate tracking performance and disturbance rejection, the RC is developed and applied to the flyback inverter in CCM operation. In the RC scheme, a low-pass filter is used to allow tracking and rejection of periodic signals within a specified frequency range. A phase lead compensator is also used to compensate for the effect of the closed-loop system dynamics. The stability of the closed-loop system is derived, and the zero tracking error is achieved. Numerical simulations validated the proposed control approach, and experimental tests using a 200-W digitally controlled module-integrated converter prototype confirmed its feasibility.},

Compared to the conventional control strategy using the proportional-integral controller, the PR controller with HC provides a higher system gain at the fundamental and harmonic frequencies of the grid without using a high proportional gain in both operation modes. Then, it enhances the tracking speed and disturbance rejection performances satisfying the desired stability. Moreover, by applying the hybrid nominal duty ratio yielded from the proposed operation mode selection, the disturbance rejection is achieved more effectively, and the control burden is reduced. Finally, the simulation and experimental results were shown to verify the tracking speed and disturbance rejection performances of the proposed control strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a boost-multilevel inverter design with integrated battery energy storage system for standalone application. The inverter consists of modular switched-battery cells and a full-bridge. It is multifunctional and has two modes of operation: 1) the charging mode, which charges the battery bank and 2) the inverter mode, which supplies ac power to the load. This inverter topology requires significantly less power switches compared to conventional topology such as cascaded H-bridge multilevel inverter, leading to reduced size/cost and improved reliability. To selectively eliminate low-order harmonics and control the desired fundamental component, nonlinear system equations are represented in fitness function through the manipulation of modulation index and the genetic algorithm (GA) is employed to find the optimum switching angles. A seven-level inverter prototype is implemented and experimental results are provided to verify the feasibility of the proposed inverter design.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes microstepping via a proximate in-phase current estimator (PIpCE) to improve position control performance with reduced torque ripples in permanent-magnet (PM) stepping motors. In conventional microstepping control, low-pass filters (LPFs) are used to filter out measurement noise resulting from the implemented current feedback loops. However, the phase lag caused by LPFs can degrade position control performance. In this paper, we propose a current tracking controller with PIpCE. The globally uniformly ultimately bounded current tracking error is proved via the Lyapunov theory. The proposed PIpCE also enhances current tracking performance over that of the conventional method. The proposed controller not only reduces the torque ripple caused by the phase lag but also increases the operational range of microstepping by pushing the electromechanical resonance frequency to a high-frequency region. We experimentally validated the effectiveness of the proposed method and observed that this method provides uniform position tracking performance without step-out or speed reversal, even in high-speed operation.},

  Abstract                 = {Intelligent fault diagnosis is a promising tool to deal with mechanical big data due to its ability in rapidly and efficiently processing collected signals and providing accurate diagnosis results. In traditional intelligent diagnosis methods, however, the features are manually extracted depending on prior knowledge and diagnostic expertise. Such processes take advantage of human ingenuity but are time-consuming and labor-intensive. Inspired by the idea of unsupervised feature learning that uses artificial intelligence techniques to learn features from raw data, a two-stage learning method is proposed for intelligent diagnosis of machines. In the first learning stage of the method, sparse filtering, an unsupervised two-layer neural network, is used to directly learn features from mechanical vibration signals. In the second stage, softmax regression is employed to classify the health conditions based on the learned features. The proposed method is validated by a motor bearing dataset and a locomotive bearing dataset, respectively. The results show that the proposed method obtains fairly high diagnosis accuracies and is superior to the existing methods for the motor bearing dataset. Because of learning features adaptively, the proposed method reduces the need of human labor and makes intelligent fault diagnosis handle big data more easily.},

  Abstract                 = {Methane is the primary constituent of natural gas and is used in many industrial processes. Detection of the presence of methane is important, especially before it reaches explosive concentrations. Earlier sensor types are based on catalytic adsorption (which may limit the sensor lifetime) at elevated temperatures (requiring additional power and possibly compromising safety). Recently, optical sensors based on infrared (IR) absorption by hydrocarbon molecules have become an important research focus. One unsolved problem when using solid-state IR sources is that of optical flux variation due to heating. This paper introduces a novel power compensation approach for IR LEDs employed in gas detection, which accounts for variations in the optical flux of the source. The contribution of this paper is threefold. First, we propose the idea of compensating for emitted IR flux by means of pulsed junction voltage measurement and explain why this is effective. Second, we introduce a compensation algorithm which shows how to take advantage of this concept. Third, experimental results demonstrate that the discrimination algorithm is at least six times better than the uncompensated measurements. The convergence of the algorithm results in a stabilized measurement in less than 1 s.},

New more complex inverter topologies and new application fields come along with additional control challenges, such as voltage imbalances, power-quality issues, higher efficiency needs, and fault-tolerant operation, which necessarily requires the parallel development of modulation schemes. Therefore, recently, there have been significant advances in the field of modulation of dc/ac converters, which conceptually has been dominated during the last several decades almost exclusively by classic pulse-width modulation (PWM) methods.

This approach utilizes a finite state machine to implement a gait period detector to estimate the current gait period of the user among the six major periods. Furthermore, an impedance-based controller is used to produce the functional gait assistance at the hip and the knee joint in each detected gait period. This is the first experimental trial to offer gait assistance based on gait period functionality. The goal of this controller is to assist the gait of the impaired persons in order to reduce the walking efforts in their daily living. The performance of this approach is investigated on a single-leg lower extremity assistive device with a group of healthy subjects walking on a treadmill. Joint kinematics, assistive torques from assisted trial, and heart rates from all trials are recorded. Preliminary evaluation shows that this approach is capable of providing functional task gait assistance at hip and knee joint of the subject under varying walking speeds during level walking. In particular, at a constant speed of 1 km/h with five healthy subjects, when assisted with the device, it reduces their heart rate to statistically resemble the free-walking heart rates. Additionally, it decreases their physical efforts to substantially improve their performance, compared with their unassisted conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {Active structural control is a promising and effective approach to load reduction of floating wind turbines. This paper investigates use of active structural control to mitigate loads of a floating wind turbine on a barge platform. Different from the existing results, static output feedback is employed as the control law for reducing implementation complexity while a turned mass damper is considered to be installed on the platform instead of in the nacelle. To design active structural controllers, first an input-output linear design model for the wind turbine is identified from time response data, and then an advanced generalized H_{\infty } method is employed for optimizing the controller gain so as to reduce wave induced loads. Through high-fidelity simulation results of the wind turbine, it is found that the designed active controllers could further reduce the main fatigue load and the generator power error, but the standard H_{\infty } one is not economical and lacks enough reliability. The rationale of the generalized H_{\infty } method in trading off load reduction and controller gain reduction is also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we present a novel work in which an iterative learning control (ILC) method is applied to a two-link Carangiform robotic fish in real time and achieves precise speed tracking performance. By virtue of the Lagrangian mechanics method, we establish a mathematical model for the robotic fish. The robotic fish model is highly nonlinear and nonaffine in control input, which hinders the applicability of most control methods that require affine-in-input. ILC is suitable because it works for such circumstances. A P-type ILC algorithm is adopted for speed tracking tasks of the robotic fish. The rigorous convergence analysis is derived based on composite energy function (CEF). In practice, the precise model of robotic fish is difficult to be obtained due to many uncertain factors. By employing ILC, the speed tracking control performance can be improved significantly without using the perfect model. Both simulations and experiments are conducted to illustrate the effectiveness of ILC, and excellent speed tracking is achieved for the robotic fish.},

  Abstract                 = {The circulating current in phase legs is an inherent phenomenon of modular multilevel converters (MMCs). The circulating current affects various aspects of MMC performance, such as power losses, capacitor voltage ripples, and the required current rating of semiconductors. Existing circulating current control methods can improve MMC performance in one aspect, but they may not implement the optimal performance in various aspects. Analytically analyzing how circulating current control affects MMC performance is essential. This paper proposes an improved steady-state analysis method that considers circulating current control. The influence of circulating current control is included by considering the effects of the second-harmonic component on reference voltages. Explicit analytical expressions for various electrical quantities can be derived, and the analytical calculation curves of some MMC performance indexes concerned under varying second-harmonic reference voltages can be obtained. Accordingly, the effects of circulating current control on MMC performance can be concluded, where a theoretical foundation for the accurate design of MMC parameters is provided. In addition, the obtained analytical calculation curves can be used to evaluate different circulating current control targets and find appropriate control targets to comprehensively improve MMC performance. Both simulation and experimental results verify the validity of the proposed steady-state analysis method and the corresponding conclusions.},

This paper investigates the influence of machine saliency on a sensorless control operation based on different MWCs. First, by injecting an HF carrier signal, the machine saliency level can be evaluated experimentally. The influence of saliency on an HF-signal-injection-based sensorless operation for different MWCs can be then investigated irrespective of any information of machine parameters. However, the secondary saliency caused by magnetic saturation or current harmonics may exist in a machine, due to which the sensorless control performance will deteriorate. Hence, an orthogonal signal-based position tracking observer is proposed to improve the accuracy of rotor position estimation rather than utilizing an existing position observer. Furthermore, experimental results confirm that a prototype machine exhibits different saliency characteristics and apparent saliency, in which the HF-injection-based sensorless control technique can be applied. Moreover, better steady and dynamic state performance can be achieved by the improved position estimator compared with using an existing position observer.},

This paper proposes an improved population model with lockout time considered to describe the aggregate dynamics.

Full derivations of the system model and the DMPC scheme are provided. A flexibility penalty is developed and added to the objective function to preserve the regulation flexibility.

  Abstract                 = {As the penetration level of photovoltaic (PV) generators into the grid is rapidly increasing, the effect of a variable PV power output on the stability of power systems cannot be ignored. Due to the stochastic characteristics of PV power generation, deterministic analysis approaches are not able to fully reveal the impact of high-level PV integration. This paper investigates the impact of the stochastic PV generation on the dynamic stability of grid-connected PV systems by using a probabilistic small-signal analysis approach. The sensitivity of the critical eigenvalue to the variation of solar irradiance is obtained. With the knowledge of the sensitivity relationship and the statistics of solar irradiance data, the probability density function (pdf) of the real part of the critical eigenvalue is approximated by Gram-Charlier expansion. This pdf is then used to calculate the probability of the stochastic small-signal stability of a power system. The impacts of important system parameters on the stochastic stability of the system are also analyzed. It has been found that these system parameters can significantly affect the stochastic stability of the system. Results of Monte Carlo and time-domain simulations of the grid-connected system verify the effectiveness of the proposed stochastic stability analysis method.},

  Abstract                 = {A high-order (LCL or LLCL) power filter with a small grid-side inductor is becoming more preferred for a grid-tied inverter due to less total inductance and reduced costs. In a microgrid, the background harmonic voltage (BHV) may distort the injected currents of the grid-tied inverters. In order to resist the effect of the BHV, a feedforward voltage compensator and a proportional resonant regulator with harmonic compensation are often adopted. However, they still have their own limitations, particularly when there are higher order BHVs at the point of common coupling and when the equivalent grid impedance widely varies due to the different numbers of grid-tied inverters in parallel. Thus, an extra damper should be inserted to keep the system stable. In this paper, the control bandwidth limitation of a multiloop control active damping (AD) method is analyzed and illustrated by the capacitor-current-feedback AD. Based on this, a single-loop current control with a hybrid damper is proposed for a single-phase LCLor LLCL-filter-based grid-tied inverter. A step-by-step design of the controller method is also introduced in detail. Experiments on a 2-kW prototype fully demonstrate the strong robustness of the stability and the high harmonic rejection ability of the inverter using the proposed control method.},

Two pieces of PZT ceramic plates bonded in the middle part is used to generate the first bending mode, whereas the other four on the two sides are set for the excitation of the second bending mode; their superimposition can produce elliptical movements on the two ends of the beam, which can rotate a disk-shaped rotor. Compared with the traditional ring-shaped traveling-wave piezoelectric actuator, the proposed actuator has a simpler structure and operating principle; it also gives a new mode for rotary driving. The resonance frequencies of the first and second bending modes were designed to be close at about 21.1 kHz. The maximum no-load speed and torque were tested to be 158 r/min and 0.053 N Â· m, respectively. The prototype achieved a power density of 19.0 W/kg under a weight of 15.8 g. The proposed combination plan of the first and second bending modes is very suitable for constructing a small-size piezoelectric actuator, which exhibits merits for application in small systems.},

  Abstract                 = {Single-stage power-factor-corrected (S2PFC) power supplies usually suffer from high voltage stress, due to lack of control on the intermediate bus capacitor voltage. In the past, analysis of such voltage stress was mostly based on steady-state condition without providing sufficient explanation during the transient circuit operation. This paper revisits the problem at circuit level and reports that the root cause is due to the inherent negative current feedback property of the output inductor or the transformer operating in continuous conduction mode (CCM). Based on the finding, this paper further proposes a new approach to reducing the voltage stress by adding an auxiliary circuit branch to existing S2PFC converters. The additional circuit branch limits the effect of negative current feedback by suppressing the change of output current slope due to change of load. This assists the pulsewidth modulation controller to track the change of load better such that the bus capacitor voltage range is reduced through duty cycle control. The auxiliary circuit branch also reduces reverse-recovery-related losses of the converter under CCM operation. A laboratory prototype using the popular boost PFC converter combined flyback dc/dc converter was built and tested to confirm the analysis and effectiveness of the approach.},

It may face the problems of long convergence time, potential start-up failure, and limited system stability. Different from the conventional schemes, the proposed strategy is a direct estimation method. In which, a HF pulsating carrier voltage is injected into the estimated fixed-frequency rotating reference frame other than the estimated synchronous reference frame (SRF). With this approach, spatial saliency tracking observer, which is necessary in the conventional sensorless control, is removed to simplify the control structure and improve the system stability. Furthermore, the rotor position information is directly obtained from the response of injected HF pulsating carrier signal, which can avoid potential convergence failure of tracking observer. In addition, the compensation of system delays existing in the proposed sensorless control strategy is deduced to improve the accuracy of rotor position estimation. For magnetic polarity detection, a new method which has the advantages of high signal-to-noise ratio and low vibration is also investigated. Finally, the experimental results on a PMSM indicate that the rotor position with good steady state and dynamic performance can be obtained accurately with the proposed sensorless control strategy.},

The black and white box method is divided into three steps. In the first step, a black-box method is used to identify and diagnose all of the abnormal noise sources and corresponding working conditions including rotational speeds and loading moments of the HPMSM. The proposed black method is independent of the detailed internal parameters of the HPMSM. In the second step, considering the abnormal noise sources and the corresponding working conditions diagnosed by the black-box method, a white-box method is used to propose and verify the electromagnetic field model, the structure vibration model, and the acoustic computation model of the HPMSM. Then, the components of the HPMSM whose vibrations and/or acoustic emissions are the most important are predicted. In the third step, the noise reduction method, which is aimed at the diagnosed abnormal noise source under the corresponding working conditions and the diagnosed components, is proposed. The proposed method in this paper observably raises the efficiency of diagnosis and optimization for abnormal noise of the HPMSM.},

  Abstract                 = {Synchronization unit such as single-phase grid voltage phase-locked loop (PLL) is essential to control scheme in single-phase converters. However, the design of PLL is not simple and increases the complexity of control system, and the performance of PLL could be impacted by the waveform quality of the main voltage. Therefore, in this paper, a novel single-phase power calculation method without PLL is proposed to improve the performance of single-phase three-level rectifier which is widely used in railway traction drive system. Moreover, a strategy to compensate phase angle and power calculation error is presented to improve the power calculation precision and enlarge operation range. Then the compensation strategy and the single-phase power calculation method are combined with a common direct power control (DPC) to form a no-PLL control system for single-phase three-level rectifiers. Finally, performance of the proposed scheme is verified through experimental tests and compared with two traditional PLL-based control schemes.},

  Abstract                 = {The detection of degradations and resulting failures in electronic components/systems is of paramount importance for complex industrial applications including nuclear power reactors, aerospace, automotive, and space applications. There is an increasing acceptance of the importance of detection of failures and degradations in electronic components and of the prospect of system-level health monitoring to make a key contribution to detecting and predicting any impending failures. This paper describes a parametric system identification-based health-monitoring method for detecting aging degradations of passive components in switch-mode power converters (SMPCs). A nonparametric system response is identified by perturbing the system with an optimized multitone sinusoidal signal of the order of mVs. The parametric system model is estimated from nonparametric system response using recursive weighted least-square (WLS) algorithm. Finally, the power-stage component values, including their parasitics, are extracted from numerator and denominator coefficients based on the assumed Laplace system model. These extracted component values provide direct diagnostic information of any degradation or anomalies in the components and the system. A proof of concept is initially verified on a simple point-of-load (POL) converter but the same methodology can be applied to other topologies of SMPC.},

Results are given for a three-phase three-level neutral point clamped converter running from an input voltage of 720 V and supplying a 3-kVA load.

This method not only achieves a favorable capacitor voltage balance in the symmetry system but lowers the switching frequency of MMC's devices. Second, to further reduce the switching frequency, the unbalance margin of capacitor voltages is adopted to achieve the switching between the VLM and the selective VLM (SVLM). Moreover, the system robustness has been improved by considering the situation of symmetry losing, like cell fails; in these cases, the capacitor voltages of the upper and lower arms are balanced through the collaboration of the SVLM and the reconfigurable VLM.

  Abstract                 = {For discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) dcâdc converters with digital sensorless current mode (DSCM) control, an observed current error occurs, owing to a low-accuracy current observer. Moreover, a reference current error occurs due to a low-accuracy current controller or a finite dc gain of current loop. Conventionally, the observed current is compensated to increase current regulation accuracy, whereas the reference current error is neglected. However, for charge balance principle (CBP)-based DSCM (CBP-DSCM) control, this paper proves that the reference current should be compensated in a same quantity to that of observed current. Otherwise, single or unequal compensation leads to output voltage steady-state error. For this reason, a dual current error compensation strategy for CBP-DSCM control is proposed. It compensates the errors in a same quantity through a current error observer, which considers parasitics and calculates the current errors without approximation. To verify the proposed strategy, small-signal models with parasitics for both the converter and the controller are constructed by differential functions of key variables. Furthermore, converter stability is analyzed at typical operation condition, while the stability at various operation conditions is verified through robustness analysis. Finally, simulations and experimental results verify the analysis and the improved transient response of the converter.},

In this study, a model was constructed to describe temporal neuron activity by a dot product of the PD and the movement variables vector consisting of joint torque and angular velocity. The plausibility of this model was tested by comparing estimated neural activity with that recorded from the monkey motor cortex, and it was found that this model was able to explain the temporal pattern of neuron activity irrespective of its passive responsiveness. The mean determination coefficients of neurons that responded to proprioceptive stimuli and that responded to visual stimuli were relatively high values of 0.57 and 0.58, respectively. These results suggest that neurons in the monkey motor cortex encode state variables of the arm in a framework of modern control theory and that this information could be decoded for controlling a brain-machine interface.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a new family of zero-voltage-transition (ZVT) bidirectional converters are introduced. In the proposed converters, soft-switching condition for all semiconductor elements is provided regardless of the power flow direction and without any extra voltage and current stress on the main switches. The auxiliary circuit is composed of a coupled inductor with the converter main inductor and two auxiliary switches. The auxiliary switches benefit from significantly reduced voltage stress and without requiring floating gate drive circuit. Also, by applying the synchronous rectification to the auxiliary switches body diodes, conduction losses of the auxiliary circuit are reduced. In the auxiliary circuit, the leakage inductor is used as the resonant inductor and all the magnetic components are implemented on a single core which has resulted in significant reduction of the converter volume. In the proposed converters, the reverse recovery losses of the converter-rectifying diodes are completely eliminated and hence, using the low-speed body diode of the power switch as the converter-rectifying diode is feasible. The theoretical analysis for a bidirectional buck and boost converter is presented in detail and the validity of the theoretical analysis is justified using the experimental results of a 250-W prototype converter.},

  Abstract                 = {Lithium (Li)-ion battery cells suffer from significant performance degradation at subzero temperatures. This paper presents a predictive control-based technique that exploits the increased internal resistance of Li-ion cells at subzero temperatures to increase the cell's temperature until the desired power can be delivered. Specifically, the magnitude of a sequence of bidirectional currents is optimized such as to minimize total energy discharged. The magnitude of current is determined by solving an optimization problem that satisfies the battery manufacturer's voltage and current constraints. Drawing bidirectional currents necessitates that a temporary energy reservoir for energy shuttling, such as an ultracapacitor or another battery, be available. When compared with the case when no penalty on energy withdrawn is imposed, simulations indicate that reductions of up to 20% in energy dispensed as heat in the battery as well as in the size of external storage elements can be achieved at the expense of longer warm-up operation time.},

Simulation and experimental results obtained from a 60-W hardware prototype have confirmed the validity of the proposed method, where the settling time of the output current has been improved by 90% and the ripple of the output current has been reduced to less than 4% under rated current.

  Abstract                 = {There is an emerging application, which uses a mixture of batteries within an energy storage system. These hybrid battery solutions may contain different battery types. A dc-side cascaded boost converters along with a module-based distributed power sharing strategy has been proposed to cope with variations in battery parameters such as, state-of-charge (SOC) and/or capacity. This power sharing strategy distributes the total power among the different battery modules according to these battery parameters. Each module controller consists of an outer voltage-loop with an inner current-loop where the desired control reference for each control-loop needs to be dynamically varied according to battery parameters to undertake this sharing. As a result, the designed control bandwidth (BW) or stability margin of each module control-loop may vary in a wide range, which can cause a stability problem within the cascaded converter. This paper reports such a unique issue and thoroughly investigates the stability of the modular converter under the distributed sharing scheme. The paper shows that a cascaded PI control-loop approach cannot guarantee the system stability throughout the operating conditions. A detailed analysis of the stability issue and the limitations of the conventional approach are highlighted. Finally in-depth experimental results are presented to prove the stability issue using a modular hybrid battery energy storage system prototype under various operating conditions.},

The above control schemes have been implemented in the laboratory using 2 HP IM through a DSPACE DS-1104 controller. The control schemes are capable to balance the dc-link capacitor voltages of TDCI by selecting an optimum voltage vector without using an extra controller. However, the three-level PIDTC of an IM gives poor transient performance during starting, loading, and speed reversal with considerable current and voltage total harmonic distortion (THD). In addition, it takes more time to reach the steady state with large spikes on capacitor voltages during the load or speed variation. This is due to poor performance of the PI controllers (speed and torque). In F2DTC, the conventional PI controllers are replaced by Mamdani-type fuzzy-2 controllers using a centroid method with simple logical rules. The simulated and experimental performance show that F2DTC for the three-level inverter-fed IM drive provides a fast dynamic response, less current and voltage THDs, considerable less distortion in flux and torque, and fewer spikes on capacitor voltages as compared to PIDTC.},

An experimental test-rig is used to acquire the required inputs for the developed state estimation technique. The estimated rotor currents and fault parameter are analyzed to identify key signatures for condition monitoring (CM). The harmonic components such as the second harmonic components of the estimated field and damper currents, and the rms value of the estimated fault parameters are identified as suitable signatures for winding fault and diagnose. Based on the identified signatures, a model-based CM algorithm is proposed and validated in real time.

  Abstract                 = {SiC MOSFETs are applied to constitute a three-phase, 5-kW LLC series resonant dc/dc converter with isolation transformers. A switching frequency of around 200 kHz for the transistors successfully reduces the volume of these isolation transformers, whereas insulated-gate bipolar transistors (IGBTs) are not capable of achieving such a high switching speed. The high-voltage tolerance of SiC MOSFETs, 1200 V, enables increasing the input voltage up to 600 V. High-voltage tolerance, on the other hand, is not compatible with low on-resistance for Si MOSFETs. A three-phase circuit topology is used to achieve up to 5 kW of power capacity for the converter and reduce per-phase current at the same time. Current-balancing transformers among these three phases effectively suppress a maximum peak current from arising in the circuit, a technique that miniaturizes the input and output capacitances. The conversion efficiency of the converter reaches 97.6% at 5-kW operation.},

  Abstract                 = {Multilevel inverters are gaining more attention in ac drive application due to their many attractive features. In the case of conventional neutral-point-clamped (NPC) or flying capacitor multilevel inverter configurations, active switches are connected in series to produce multilevel output voltage waveform. Therefore, if any one switch fails, the entire configuration has to be shut down; this will reduce the reliability of the system. A dual three-level inverter configuration for induction motor drive is proposed in this paper to improve reliability of the system. This topology is developed by feeding four-pole induction motor stator winding with four conventional two-level inverter modules. A level-shifted carrier-based third harmonic injection pulsewidth-modulation technique is used to produce the gating signals for the proposed configuration. By providing proper phase shift between carrier waves, multilevel voltage waveform is produced across the total motor phase winding, and first center band harmonics are also canceled. Thereby, the torque ripple will be considerably reduced compared with conventional NPC five-level inverter-driven induction motor drive. Finite-element analysis (FEA) is used to estimate the torque ripple when induction motor is supplied by the proposed configuration and conventional five-level NPC inverter configuration to show the effectiveness of the proposed converter. The proposed configuration is simulated using MATLAB/Simulink and experimentally verified using a laboratory prototype with a 5-hp four-pole induction motor drive.},

The proposed hybrid design incorporates the advantageous features of both the conventional axial and radial flux hysteresis motors (RFHMs) in a unique structure. The design aspects and constraints of the proposed machine are based on a prestudied single-sided axial flux hysteresis motor (AFHM). In order to analyze the electromagnetic performance of the proposed structure and investigate the geometry specifications of the designed machine, a three-dimensional (3-D) finite-element analysis (FEA) is conducted. The hysteresis loop modeling is done based on the elliptical approximation of the hysteresis loop by considering the saturation during the FEA with an iterative method. Finally, in order to investigate the electromagnetic performance of the proposed device and the accuracy of the design and analysis approach, a prototype is built. The test results validate the good performance of the proposed machine.},

  Abstract                 = {Process-level communication network brings digital technology to the high-voltage switchyard, a major stage in the evolution to ensure the protection control and data acquisition of smart substation. This network requires a mission-critical protocol such as high-availability seamless redundancy (HSR). Two main drawbacks of HSR, however, are the transmission latency introduced by each hop in the single ring (SR) topology and the unnecessary traffic due to the duplicated copies of sending frames. This study presents two enhanced solutions and fully implements quick removing (QR) approach to HSR for improving the latency and reducing the traffic volume in process-level network. The main idea of these two enhanced solutions is to reduce the minimum number of hops required for delivery messages to destinations for reducing the maximum end-to-end latency (ML). To achieve traffic reduction, the QR approach is concretized in HSR nodes for fully applying to any closed-loop HSR networks. Performance of IEC 61850-based process bus networks are analyzed theoretically and demonstratively by Network Simulator-2 (NS-2) and OPNET ModelerÂ®. The combination of enhanced solutions and the QR algorithm solves both main drawbacks of HSR, improving the network performance optimally. These enhancements of HSR are applicable to not only on substation automation networks, but also to any real-time industrial networks.},

The dynamic performance of the prototype machine at or near base speed was found to be comparable to a distributed wound IPMSM. However, the lowest operating speed of the machine under sensorless control scheme was only about 30% of the base speed. This paper demonstrates experimentally that this lack of performance can be overcome substantially by using the extended-flux linkage model and high-frequency (HF) injection methods. By using the extended-flux model, the lowest operable speed was reduced from 30% to 5% of the base speed. In order to operate the machine, at a standstill under sensorless control, the HF injection method was employed. Factors that affect the performance at zero speed were investigated systematically.},

In addition, a simple approach to realize the carrier-based pulsewidth modulation (CBPWM) method for a three-to-five-phase IMC is presented, and the proposed CBPWM method is analyzed based on the space-vector approach. As a result, the IMC with the proposed CBPWM method can be more easily implemented compared with IMCs with the space-vector PWM method.

This paper proposes a complete solution to the efficiency enhancement of general induction motor (IM) drive systems with the least cost and a high reliability. On the motor side, the squirrel-cage rotors of IMs are replaced with optimally designed interior permanent-magnet (PM) rotors without damping windings; meanwhile, other assemblies remained unchanged. Stators with both wye- and delta-connected windings are investigated, and super premium efficiency (IE4) is achieved on all the remanufactured motors in this paper. On the drive side, the maximum efficiency per ampere algorithm is realized based on the position-sensorless control to better exert the motor efficiency and reduce the system cost. For applications where an original IM is used under a grid drive, this paper safely switches the remanufactured interior PM synchronous motors from an inverter to the grid drive. A total of seven prototypes with different rated powers and velocities are remanufactured, and various experiments are provided as the verifications of the effectiveness and practicability of the proposed solution.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents two linear power sharing schemes for distributed generators (DGs). The purpose is to reduce the total generation cost (TGC) of the considered autonomous microgrid. The saving in cost is realized by tuning the DG droop gradients in accordance to their respective maximum or mean generation costs. Compared with the existing nonlinear cost-based schemes, the proposed schemes use linear droop functions, which are easier to tune and implement in practice for a greater reduction in TGC. The proposed schemes have been tested experimentally with an example microgrid powered first by dispatchable DGs only, and then by a combination of dispatchable and nondispatchable DGs. Experimental results obtained have demonstrated the anticipated outcomes under different operating conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {An application of an evolutionary game dynamics called mixed strategist dynamics (MSD), for the decentralized load scheduling of plug-in electric vehicles (PEVs), is proposed in this paper. Following an analogy with the maximum entropy principle (MEP) for tuning parameters of discrete probability distributions, entropy of the total load distribution and the local load distributions are considered as objectives of the scheduling approach, and a tradeoff among them is defined by the electric vehicle owners' convenience. While entropy maximization for the local load distributions contributes to preserve the batteries' states of health, entropy maximization for the total load distribution reduces the undesirable peak effects over the transformer loading. The problem is formulated such that final states of charge are assured depending on time constraints defined by the owners. Furthermore, mixed strategies in the MSD are defined such that they represent the vertices of the convex set of feasible load profiles which results from the constraints imposed by owners and chargers. The synergy of several PEVs is modeled as an application of the MSD in a multipopulation scenario, where the interaction among populations follows another evolutionary game dynamics called best reply (BR) dynamics. The performance of the proposed approach is tested on real data measured on a distribution transformer from the SOREA utility grid company in the region of Savoie, France.},

Network communication constraints, such as network-induced delay, packet disorder, and packet dropout in both the feedback and forward channels, are considered and further treated as the round-trip time (RTT) delay that is redefined. By using the packet-based transmission mechanism and the model-free adaptive control algorithm, a data-based networked predictive control method is proposed to actively compensate for the random RTT delay. The proposed method does not require any information on the plant model and depends only on the input and output data of the plant. A simple and explicit sufficient condition, which is related to the upper bound of the RTT delays, is derived for the stability of the closed-loop system. Additionally, a zero steady-state output tracking error can be achieved for a step reference input. The effectiveness of the proposed method is demonstrated via simulation and experimental results.},

The coupling effects between both the stator and the rotor have been taken into account by the computation of statorârotor mutual inductances. The model has been developed under the MATLAB/Simulink environment in order to have a universal tool that is easy to use with any control techniques. With this model, it is possible to simulate any type of electrical faults during the motion by closing or opening corresponding switches. The performances of the model have been validated by comparing simulation and experimental results of a 90-W 14-V 50-Hz two-pole 6PIM operating with different levels of load torque in healthy and faulty modes. Furthermore, this model has been associated to a fault-tolerant speed control method in phase opening occurrences in order to test the model accuracy.},

The dependence of the parameters on the state of charge, current direction and magnitude (20-200 A), and temperatures ranging from -40 Â°C to 60 Â°C is incorporated in the model. The thermal model is a linear 1-D model with two states. The reversible heat generation which is significant in double-layer capacitors is included in the thermal model. The coupling of the two models enables tuning of the temperature-dependent parameters of the electrical model in real time. The coupled electrothermal model is validated using real-world duty cycles at subzero and room temperatures with root-mean-square errors of (82 mV-87 mV) and (0.17 Â°C-0.21 Â°C) for terminal voltage and temperature, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the design and the realization of a low-frequency ac magnetic-field-based indoor positioning system (PS). The system operation is based on the principle of inductive coupling between wire loop antennas. Specifically, due to the characteristics of the ac artificially generated magnetic fields, the relation between the induced voltage and the distance is modeled with a linear behavior in a bilogarithmic scale when a configuration with coplanar, thus equally oriented, antennas is used. In this case, the distance between a transmitting antenna and a receiving one is estimated using measurements of the induced voltage in the latter. For a high operational range, the system makes use of resonant antennas tuned at the same nominal resonant frequency. The quality factors act as antenna gain increasing the amplitude of the induced voltage. The low-operating frequency is the key factor for improving robustness against nonline-of-sight (NLOS) conditions and environment influences with respect to other existing solutions. The realized prototype, which is implemented using off-the-shelf components, exhibits an average and maximum positioning error, respectively, lower than 0.3 and 0.9 m in an indoor environment over a large area of 15 m Ã 12 m in NLOS conditions. Similar performance is obtained in an outdoor environment over an area of 30 m Ã 14 m. Furthermore, the system does not require any type of synchronization between the nodes and can accommodate an arbitrary number of users without additional infrastructure.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the robust and accurate capture of human joint poses and bio-kinematic movements for exercise monitoring in real-time tele-rehabilitation applications. Recently developed model-based estimation ideas are used to improve the accuracy, robustness, and real-time characteristics considered vital for applications, where affordability and domestic use are the primary focus. We use the spatial diversity of the arbitrarily positioned Microsoft Kinect receivers to improve the reliability and promote the uptake of the concept. The skeleton-based information is fused to enhance accuracy and robustness, critical for biomedical applications. A specific version of a robust Kalman filter (KF) in a linear framework is employed to ensure superior estimator convergence and real-time use, compared to other commonly used filters. The algorithmic development was conducted in a generic form and computer simulations were conducted to verify our assertions. Hardware implementations were carried out to test the viability of the proposed state estimator in terms of the core requirements of reliability, accuracy, and real-time use. Performance of the overall system implemented in an information fusion context was evaluated against the commercially available and industry standard Vicon system for different exercise routines, producing comparable results with much less infrastructure and financial investment.},

Consequently, the sampling interval can be adaptively adjusted. Therefore, the communication burden can be greatly reduced and the energy efficiency can be much improved while preserving the desired Hâ performance.

The proposed wind generator (WG) is based on a back-to-back power converter topology with two voltage source inverters and contains previously developed neural-based MPPT, as well as an original version of an ELMT. The proposed wind generation unit has been experimentally tested on a suitably developed test set-up. Results clearly show that the integration of ELMT+D-PWM into the MPPT-based WG control permits the active power injected into the power grid to be increased up to 37.5% at high wind speeds and up to 240% at low wind speeds.},

The same topology has been tried for single-phase power decoupling and single-phase acâdcâac conversion, where comparably lesser switches are needed. Although the basic modulation principle is still reliant on three modulating references for the three phase legs, requirements imposed on the modulating references are different and usually asymmetrical. How these asymmetrical references should be formulated to meet various performance specifications of a single-phase B6 converter is the theme of this paper.

  Abstract                 = {A new impedance-based approach is introduced in which the integral battery temperature is related to other frequencies than the recently developed zero-intercept frequency (ZIF). The advantage of the proposed non-ZIF (NZIF) method is that measurement interferences, resulting from the current flowing through the battery (pack), can be avoided at these frequencies. This gives higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNRs) and, consequently, more accurate temperature measurements. A theoretical analysis, using an equivalent circuit model of a Li-ion battery, shows that NZIFs are temperature dependent in a way similar to the ZIF and can therefore also be used as a battery temperature indicator. To validate the proposed method, impedance measurements have been performed with individual LiFePO4 batteries and with large LiFePO4 battery packs tested in a full electric vehicle under driving conditions. The measurement results show that the NZIF is clearly dependent on the integral battery temperature and reveals a similar behavior to that of the ZIF method. This makes it possible to optimally adjust the NZIF method to frequencies with the highest SNR.},

  Abstract                 = {A four-level open-end winding induction motor (OEWIM) drive is known to suffer from two perennial problems. One is the problem of zero-sequence current in the motor phases, which is caused by the existence of zero-sequence voltage in them. The other is the overcharging of the dc-link capacitor of the inverter operated with lower dc-link voltage by its counterpart operated with a higher dc-link voltage. This paper investigates the applicability of a special variant of space vector pulse width modulation (SVPWM) scheme for a recently proposed power circuit configuration, in which a rectifier-inverter combination is nested within the conventional two-level inverter configuration to achieve four-level inversion. This PWM scheme is named as the sample-averaged zero-sequence elimination (SAZE) SVPWM scheme, wherein the zero sequence voltage is suppressed in each sampling time period in the average sense. Both of the aforementioned problems encountered in this drive are successfully overcome for this power circuit configuration by resorting to the proposed SVPWM strategy.},

  Abstract                 = {The compound active-clamp zero-voltage switching three-phase power factor correction (PFC) converter is used as the first stage converter of the heating power supply in the monocrystalline silicon growth furnace to achieve high efficiency and high power factor. Parameter uncertainty and variation are the main problems for the controller design of the converter. The conventional methods, including proportional-integral (PI) control, exact feedback linearization (EFL) control, etc., cannot deal with such problems. In this paper, we propose a model reference adaptive control for voltage outer loop to achieve adaptation for the load and capacitor variations, as well as a variable structure control with shrinking boundary layer for current inner loop to improve robustness to the parameters uncertainty. The simulation and experiment results show that the proposed controller improves the power factor and efficiency of the system, and it has better transient and steady-state performance with respect to the load variation, as compared with the traditional PI control method and the EFL control method.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper deepens in the study of the recently described diffusive proton exchange membrane fuel cell (FC) model. This model has demonstrated a close agreement to the experimental data provided by a real FC. The diffusive model is approximated by a finite-dimensional model that allows formulating an optimization problem of least square error type to estimate the model distribution. The diffusive model is identified by means of experimental measurements of current (input) and voltage (output) in the FC. It is well known that the FC static current-voltage characteristic has three operation regions, with only the ohmic region being strictly linear, so that it is very difficult to approximate the whole operation range with a linear model. Therefore, a new method is presented in this paper extending the diffusive approach by means of a linear parameter-varying model with the aim to overcome the limitations of linear time-invariant models. In addition, discrete-time expressions for the new diffusive model approach are derived. The obtained model is simple and can be used in systems that require real-time emulators or complex long-time simulations. Experimental results using the Ballard Nexa 1.2-kW FC illustrate the advantages of the new diffusive model approach with respect to previous reports.},

The proposed device is useful for powering of wireless sensor nodes in smart monitoring applications. The device includes a piezoelectric beam that vibrates due to the interactions between miniaturized permanent magnets (PMs) embedded in a small turbine and a magnet at the tip of the beam. The design method determines the resonance frequency of the beam with respect to the wind speed distribution model. Compared to the conventional wideband topologies that include multiple beams for resonating at different frequencies, the suggested topology uses a single beam and achieves the wideband feature via the arrangement of PMs within the turbine. This feature enhances the power density of the piezoelectric wind energy harvester. The wideband feature of the device is experimentally verified using a device prototype in which the beam resonance occurs at the fan rotational speeds of 155.0, 193.5, 257.9, and 387.0 rad/s. The maximum power density, maximum efficiency, and cut-in wind speed of the device are 0.59 mW/cm3, 24%, and 2.1 m/s, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {Sensorless torsion control is proposed for elastic-joint robots, with the geared drives subject to hysteresis and friction nonlinearities. The concept of the so-called âvirtual torsion sensorâ uses the motor torque and velocity, inherently available in most industrial robots, for estimating the reactive joint torque and predicting, based thereupon, the nonlinear joint torsion. The dynamics of the elastic-joint robot is described and augmented by a rate-independent torsion-torque hysteresis and nonlinear friction assumed on the side of motor drives. The classical two-degrees-of-freedom robot control, which includes the centralized torque feedforward control and proportional-derivative feedback control, is extended by the virtual torsion sensor in the loop. In particular, we show that the computed joint torsion can be injected in the feedback loop upon the motor position, thus making the control operating in a âvirtualâ joint output (link) space. The proposed control is experimentally evaluated on a single-joint setup consisting of an actuator with harmonic-drive gear and inertial load under additional impact of gravity.},

Our scheme is based on power map matching algorithm that is capable in estimating the location and orientation of objects. Unlike conventional power map matching schemes, which create the map from actual measurements, the proposed power map is automatically generated based on a simple mathematical model. The application under consideration is based on two-dimensional (2-D) open spatial environment where the area of each object is no less than a quarter of a square meter with position estimation errors stretching to tens of centimeters. This work provides an alternative and relatively cheap approach for remotely estimating the pose of an object.

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes an acceleration-based robust controller for the motion control problem, i.e., position and force control problems, of a novel series elastic actuator (SEA). A variable stiffness SEA is designed by using soft and hard springs in series so as to relax the fundamental performance limitation of conventional SEAs. Although the proposed SEA intrinsically has several superiorities in force control, its motion control problem, especially position control problem, is harder than conventional stiff and SEAs due to its special mechanical structure. It is shown that the performance of the novel SEA is limited when conventional motion control methods are used. The performance of the steady-state response is significantly improved by using disturbance observer (DOb), i.e., improving the robustness; however, it degrades the transient response by increasing the vibration at tip point. The vibration of the novel SEA and external disturbances are suppressed by using resonance ratio control (RRC) and arm DOb, respectively. The proposed method can be used in the motion control problem of conventional SEAs as well. The intrinsically safe mechanical structure and high-performance motion control system provide several benefits in industrial applications, e.g., robots can perform dexterous and versatile industrial tasks alongside people in a factory setting. The experimental results show viability of the proposals.},

With small LC filters comes a high cutoff frequency, and the conventional stability analysis based on an average model may not be precise enough. Other tools based on another model are required to study this type of system. In this paper, a new discrete-time model is proposed to investigate the behavior of the studied system and to take into account the switching effect. Then, the stability analysis of the limit cycle is done using Floquet multipliers. This system is composed of a dc-dc boost converter, an LC filter, and a controlled power load.

  Abstract                 = {Electrical double-layer capacitors (EDLCs) are now widely used as power buffers in energy storage systems, especially for electrical transport applications. Because of their high acquisition costs, their predictive maintenance represents a key issue for the development of electrical traction systems. This paper investigates the diagnosis of EDLCs by a parametric estimation of a dynamic continuous-time model. Indeed, the physical interpretation of their parameters simplifies the supercapacitor diagnosis and prognosis. Due to the complex electrochemical phenomena occurring in EDLC cells, modeling errors are far more important than measurement noise. Therefore, we propose to use the output error minimization techniques and the relative sensitivity functions to evaluate and compare the diagnosis potential of several model structures. This allows the use of some comprehensive comparison criteria without any assumption about the statistical characteristics of the system disturbances. An experimental accelerated aging process of 200 commercial super capacitors (Nichicon, 1F, 20 weeks long aging at 65 Â°C, 0 and 2.5 V dc polarization) is also performed to make statistics and illustrate the methodology.},

  Abstract                 = {A new multiperspective stereo concept for real-time 3-D panoramic vision is presented in this paper. The main contribution is a novel event-driven stereo approach enabling 3-D 360Â° high-dynamic-range panoramic vision for real-time application in a natural environment. This approach makes use of a sparse visual code generated by a rotating pair of dynamic vision line sensors. The use of this system allows panoramic images to be generated by the transformation of events, eliminating the need to capture a large set of images. It thereby increases the acquisition speed, which improves accuracy in dynamic scenes. This paper focuses on its 3-D reconstruction and performance analysis using such a rotating multiperspective vision system. First, a theoretical analysis of the stereo matching accuracy is performed. Second, a depth error formulation is developed, which takes motion into consideration and reveals the leverage of scene dynamics on depth estimation. In this paper, disparity is measured in time units, which allows accurate depth maps to be estimated from a moving sensor system. Third, a stereo matching workflow is presented using standard stereo image matching to assess the 3-D reconstruction accuracy. Finally, experimental results are reported on real-world sensor data, showing that the system allows for the 3-D reconstruction of high-resolution round views even under challenging illumination conditions.},

A simple analog circuit is designed to extract the PWM ripple current via a bandpass (BP) filter and a root-mean-square (RMS) detector for fault detection. In addition, this method can also identify the faulted phase, which can be used for fault mitigation strategies.

In order to achieve fast transient response and ensure the stable operation of a switching dc-dc converter over a wide load range, based on a conventional pulse train (PT) control technique, a peak capacitor current PT (PCC-PT) control technique is proposed in this paper. With a buck converter as an example, the operating modes, steady-state performance, and transient respond performance of a PCC-PT controlled buck converter are presented and assessed. To eliminate fast-scale oscillation, circuit and control parameter design considerations are given. An accurate discrete iteration model of a PCC-PT controlled buck converter is established, based on which the effects of circuit parameters on the stability of the converter operating in a discontinuous current mode (DCM), mixed DCM-continuous conduction mode (CCM), and CCM are studied.

First, the winding inductances in both the stator reference frame and the dq -axes reference frame are analyzed. It should be noted that the characteristics of the 12-phase winding inductances are different from those of its three-phase counterpart. The largest mutual inductance is much smaller than half of the self-inductance, and most mutual inductances are negligible, which brings the benefit of improved magnetic isolation between phases and causes the 12th-order inductance matrix to be sparse. Thereafter, an accurate inductance model is established, taking account of the magnetic coupling between adjacent three-phase winding sets. Finally, a flux-linkage equation, a voltage equation, a power equation, and a torque equation are derived in sequence. The effectiveness of the proposed mathematical model is verified by comparing the theoretical results with 2-D finite-element-analysis-based predictions. The work in this paper lays an important foundation for the control strategy of the 12-phase FSPM machine.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, the Class-Fn/E power amplifier (PA) and the inverse Class-E (Class-E-1) PA under zero-current switching and zero-current-derivative switching conditions at any duty ratio are analyzed. The maximum switch voltage and current, output power capability, and element values as functions of the duty ratio are obtained for both classes. The main objective of the analysis is to choose the proper duty ratio to maximize the output power capabilities at optimum conditions. The element values are dependent upon the duty ratio and require a careful selection of the duty ratio to reach desired specification. The effect of the duty ratio D = 0.3-0.7 on the performance of the Class-E-1 and Class-F3/E PAs is demonstrated. The duty ratio is used not only as the design specification but also as the adjusting parameter for achieving a certain condition. The measured maximum drain efficiency of 88% and 87% are obtained at 4 MHz at 30-dBm input power for the Class-F3/E and Class-E-1 PAs, respectively. The results show that lower peak switch voltage and current are obtained in the Class-F3/E PA in comparison with Class-E-1 for the same conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {The flux-switching permanent-magnet (FSPM) machine attracts increasing attention recently due to its high power density, robust mechanical structure, good flux-weakening capability, and essential sinusoidal back-electromotive-force waveforms. In previous studies, the approach for analyzing FSPM machines is either by using the lumped parameter magnetic circuit models or from the âgenerator-orientedâ perspective. In this paper, the operating principle of FSPM machines is reiterated from a new perspective, viz., the âmotor-orientedâ perspective. Some interesting findings and essential principles can be unveiled, which include how the stable electromagnetic torque can be developed, how the pole-pair number (PPN) of armature windings, the PPN of PMs, and the synchronous speed of the armature field should be defined, and how to determine the connection of coils for the sake of developing stable electromagnetic torques. This new perspective is more consistent with the classical theory on electric machines. There is no need to consider the polarity of coils when determining the connection of windings. Three typical FSPM machines with different combinations of stator and rotor poles, viz., 12/11-pole, 12/13-pole, and 12/26-pole, are investigated to verify the validity of the proposed analysis approach. Experimental verification concerning the latter two sample machines is also conducted.},

  Abstract                 = {A dynamic model is presented by coupling the structural dynamics of a Galfenol-driven unimorph beam with the magnetostriction generated by the active layer. Weak form equations are obtained by employing the virtual work principle, and finite-element representation of the model is implemented through a Galerkin discretization. In order to facilitate the design of the controller, a linearized constitutive law is used to describe the magnetostriction of Galfenol. A finite-dimensional sliding-mode controller is developed which accounts for the frequency-dependent deviations of structural damping and the piezomagnetic constant. A nonlinear switch controller, combined with the equivalent controller, is developed to guarantee Lyapunov stability at different frequencies, without changing the initial parameters of the controller. Since the model is finite-dimensional, model parameters are nonlinearly coupled in the state and output matrices in the state-space equation. A genetic algorithm is employed to solve the nonlinear estimation problem. Experimental results show that the model parameters are almost constant below 220 Hz. The model parameters are frequency dependent above 220 Hz. It is also found that significant performance enhancements are achieved by the proposed control relative to conventional Proportional-Integral (PI) control. The system remains stable for frequencies up to 400 Hz.},

  Abstract                 = {Of the different branches of indoor localization research, WiFi fingerprinting has drawn significant attention over the past decade. These localization systems function by comparing WiFi received signal strength indicator (RSSI) and a pre-established location-specific fingerprint map. However, due to the time-variant wireless signal strength, the RSSI fingerprint map needs to be calibrated periodically, incurring high labor and time costs. In addition, biased RSSI measurements across devices along with transmission power control techniques of WiFi routers further undermine the fidelity of existing fingerprint-based localization systems. To remedy these problems, we propose GradIent FingerprinTing (GIFT) which leverages a more stable RSSI gradient. GIFT first builds a gradient-based fingerprint map (Gmap) by comparing absolute RSSI values at nearby positions, and then runs an online extended particle filter (EPF) to localize the user/device. By incorporating Gmap, GIFT is more adaptive to the time-variant RSSI in indoor environments, thus effectively reducing the overhead of fingerprint map calibration. We implemented GIFT on Android smartphones and tablets, and conducted extensive experiments in a five-story campus building. GIFT is shown to achieve an 80 percentile accuracy of 5.6 m with dynamic WiFi signals.},

Thus, the development of monitoring tools, which are able to ensure the continuity of service by predicting faults, should improve competitiveness. This paper presents two probabilistic methods based on hidden Markov models (HMMs) for the prediction of impending faults. This paper shows that a prediction of faults is not limited to the estimation of the remaining useful life but is also extended to the estimation of the risk of an imminent appearance of faults in the future. The first method consists in modeling the degradation process of the studied system by a single HMM. A probabilistic model is proposed to predict an imminent appearance of a fault. The second method consists in modeling the degradation states by a set of HMMs. Another probabilistic model is proposed to predict an imminent appearance of a fault. An experimental application is proposed to demonstrate their applicability. The obtained results show their effectiveness to predict the imminent appearance of faults.},

Thus, substantial savings on space, weight, and cost are achieved. The considered configurations fully incorporate either a symmetrical or an asymmetrical six-phase machine, as well as a six-phase inverter, into the charging process. Due to the nature of the connections, torque production is avoided during the charging/vehicle-to-grid (V2G) modes of operation. Thus, the machines do not have to be mechanically locked, and their rotors naturally stay at standstill. Control schemes for both configurations are elaborated, and theoretical results are validated by experiments for the two configurations in both charging and V2G modes.},

In this paper, the unstable reason is analyzed. The error between the stator input voltages of the adaptive full-order observer and motor is introduced for the operation at zero stator current frequency without any signal injection. When the stator current frequency is reduced to zero, the traditional speed estimation fails to estimate the rotor speed, but the rotor speed can be estimated by the proposed stator input voltage error. The stability of the proposed method is analyzed. Although the unstable problem at zero stator current frequency can be solved by the proposed method, there is a disadvantage that an error between the estimated and actual rotor speeds is caused.

Harmonic propagation caused by power-factor correction capacitors and system inductors may lead to significant harmonic amplification throughout a closed-loop distribution feeder. This paper proposes a novel equivalent model of a closed-loop distribution feeder that a closed-loop distribution feeder can be equivalent to a radial feeder. This paper analyzes the harmonic propagation in a closed-loop distribution feeder and proposes a long-feeder simulator-based active power filter (LFS-APF) to damp out the harmonic propagation, based on the novel equivalent model. The proposed LFS-APF is installed at the middle point of a closed-loop feeder. The LFS-APF has better capability of harmonic damping than the resistive APF (RAPF), especially in response to variation of both nonlinear loads and power-factor correction capacitors or even if the installation location has to deviate from the middle point. Both simulation and experiment results are provided to validate the correctness and effectiveness of the novel equivalent model and the proposed LFS-APF.},

  Abstract                 = {Based on the equivalency between the full-bridge indirect matrix converters (MCs) and the 3 Ã 1modular MCs, the carrier-based modulation strategy is first tailored for the 3 3Ã1-modular MC. It can be directly expanded to 3ÃN-modular MC, but in order to improve the power quality, the phase-shifted (PS) method and phase disposition (PD) method are proposed. The former is suitable for the 3ÃN-modular MC with any multiwinding transformers (including phase-shifting transformers). Moreover, the latter is only applicable to the 3ÃN-modular MC with ordinary multiwinding transformers. The PD method has advantages over the PS method in the output current quality and efficiency. However, the PS method is superior to the PD method in the input current quality. Experimental results verify the correctness and effectiveness of the proposed modulation schemes.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents an adaptive sliding-mode (ASM) control methodology for a vehicle steer-by-wire (SbW) system. First, the SbW system is modeled as a second-order system from the steering motor input voltage to the front-wheel steering angle. For simplicity, the self-aligning torque and friction arising from the tire-to-ground contact are regarded as external disturbance acting on the SbW system. Next, an ASM controller is designed for the SbW system, which can not only cope with the parametric uncertainties in the plant model but also estimate the coefficient of the self-aligning torque effectively. The stability of the ASM control system is proved in the sense of Lyapunov and the guidelines for selecting the control parameters are given. Finally, experiments are carried out for steering control to respectively follow a slalom path and a circular path under various road conditions. It is shown that the proposed ASM controller can achieve stronger robustness against various road conditions leading to significantly smaller tracking errors in comparison with a conventional sliding-mode controller and a linear Hâ controller.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes haptic data quantization in communication systems in which all haptic information is transmitted through a network. From an engineering view point, bilateral control with master and slave manipulators has been studied to reproduce kinesthetic sensations. However, in scaled haptic transmission applications, communication constraints are a serious problem especially in a microspace. Moreover, communication delay deteriorates the performance of haptic sensation transmission when a large amount of data flows into a communication line. To reduce the communication delay caused by the amount of information and communication constraints, a data quantization method is discussed. Along with audio and visual information, an encoding technique is often applied to haptic information. In particular, a delta-sigma modulator based on a static quantizer has low computational complexity, and it reduces the quantization error in a low-frequency domain. Therefore, haptic sensation transmission with the modulator is constructed in quantized scaling-bilateral control. According to the analyses of hybrid parameters including the interference of a quantization error and a communication delay, the performance of haptic sensation transmission is evaluated. In experiments with a communication delay, stable operation and improved performance are achieved to reduce all information: current, position, and force.},

  Abstract                 = {Carrier-based pulsewidth-modulation (CBPWM) techniques are popular due to their simplicity, and have been widely researched for various three-phase inverter configurations. In this paper, two CBPWM techniques are proposed to reduce the common-mode (CM) voltage generated by the five-phase inverter. The five-phase inverters have more flexibility in reducing the CM voltage than their three-phase counterparts because they have more phase legs, hence finer control over the star-point voltage of the load. Two methods are proposed for the conventional two-level five-phase inverter to reduce the CM voltage; one utilizing adjacent modulating waveforms and the other utilizing nonadjacent modulating waveforms. The coupled inductor inverter (CII) uses coupled inductors to generate multilevel outputs. As the volt-second balance must be maintained across each coupled inductor, direct application of the proposed methods on the CII inverter will result in overcurrents in the coupled inductors. Hence, the proposed methods are further improved to ensure the volt-second integral over each switching period is zero. Moreover, the two proposed methods are designed to reduce switching events and prevent unexpected states occurring during the switching transitions. The performance and the switching strategy of both methods are verified by both simulations and experiments on a prototype of five-phase CII.},

  Abstract                 = {The parallel three-level dc-dc converter has some merits over the conventional two-level buck converter when employed for fast chargers in a bipolar-dc-bus charging station. It can be directly connected to the bipolar dc bus, and can operate with the total neutral-point current eliminated under the 180Â°-interleaved mode, which guarantees balanced power consumption and helps decrease dc-bus voltage fluctuation. However, this incurs circulating currents, leading to increased losses and additional current stress to switching devices. To solve this issue, an integrated inductor is proposed in this paper. The inductor has an integrated magnetic core with both output and circulating windings placed on it, producing inductances to filter output currents and to attenuate circulating currents respectively. The circulating inductance can be flexibly adjusted to be much higher than the output inductance, so that the circulating currents can be well attenuated. The output and circulating inductances, along with the ratio between them, are deduced in detail. The current ripples are analyzed and compared under two operation modes with separate and integrated inductors, respectively. The weight, losses, and volume have also been compared between separate and integrated inductors. Both simulation and experimental results are presented to verify the effectiveness of the proposed integrated inductor.},

  Abstract                 = {A novel self-powered wireless sensing micro-system is proposed and prototyped. The micro-system can autonomously monitor the amplitude of concerning vibration when it reaches a preset threshold, and wirelessly transmit alarming/notification signals when the vibration lasts for a considerable period. The event-driven sensing/alarming function is enabled by a piezoelectric energy harvester that starts to generate electric power only when the monitored vibration level reaches a critical threshold. The harvester consists of two stages of vibratory structures that interact with each other via magnetic repulsion. The bistability leads to the threshold-triggered power-generating function. For adapting to various applications, the threshold can be preset by adjusting the gap-distance between the two magnets on the two vibration stages; thereby, the power-generating action can be switched on by the concerning vibration level. The working mechanism is verified by both theoretical analysis and test for the prototyped miniature harvesters. Based on the smart energy-harvesting function, an application specific electric-energy control circuit and an RF-transmitter are designed to form a nonsupply wireless alarming system. Experimental results validate the event-driven alarming function. The abnormal vibration event-induced wireless alarming signal is autonomously transmitted to over 2 km away when the vibratory excitation lasts for 1 min to generate electrical energy of about 2 mJ.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper examines the problem of tracking control of networked multi-agent systems with multiple delays and impulsive effects, whose results are applied to mechanical robotic systems. Four kinds of impulsive effects are taken into account: 1) both the strengths of impulsive effects and the number of nodes injected with impulses are time dependent; 2) the strengths of impulsive effects occur according to certain probabilities and the number of nodes under impulsive control is time varying; 3) the strengths of impulses are time varying, whereas the number of nodes with impulses takes place according to certain probabilities; 4) both the strengths of impulses and the number of nodes with impulsive control occur according to certain probabilities. By utilizing the comparison principle, criteria are established for these different cases and a relationship between the frequencies (occurrence probabilities) of impulses and systems' parameters is unveiled. Finally, an example for tracking control of robotic systems is provided to show the effectiveness of the presented results.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a transformerless inverter topology, which is capable of simultaneously solving leakage current and pulsating power issues in grid-connected photovoltaic (PV) systems. Without adding any additional components to the system, the leakage current caused by the PV-to-ground parasitic capacitance can be bypassed by introducing a common-mode (CM) conducting path to the inverter. The resulting ground leakage current is therefore well controlled to be below the regulation limit. Furthermore, the proposed inverter can also eliminate the well-known double-line-frequency pulsating power that is inherent in single-phase PV systems. By properly injecting CM voltages to the output filter capacitors, the pulsating power can be decoupled from the dc-link. Therefore, it is possible to use long-lifetime film capacitors instead of electrolytic capacitors to improve the reliability of the PV system. The mechanism of leakage current suppression and the closed-loop control of pulsating power decoupling are discussed in this paper in detail. A 500-W prototype was also built and tested in the laboratory, and both simulation and experimental results are finally presented to show the excellent performance of the proposed PV inverter.},

In order for the online control of the proposed dcâac inverter to be feasible, a fuzzy control is designed to be a PID-like fuzzy mechanism with the complexity significantly reduced. From the results, it is shown that the PIDFC can not only stabilize the output at 110 V rms but can also improve the performance when the system load has been changed from 600 to 100 \Omega . Comparing with a traditional PID controller, the responding speed can be improved by 75% in the simulation, and the speed can still be improved by 35% in the practice experiment.},

This paper focuses on USMs with driver circuits that have a single user-controllable input. Prior to developing the robust controller, a nonlinear model of the system was identified by experimentally measuring the temporal relationship between motor speed and temperature to the applied input control signal. A linear approximation of this model was used to design two robust inverse dynamic controllers: one used temperature feedback and the other did not. Both control methods were implemented on a custom designed embedded control system and achieved highly consistent and accurate performance while under load over a range of working frequencies. Step-response experiments (1 rad) demonstrated a rise time of 0.1 s without any overshoot or steady-state error. A normalized RMSE below 3% with a delay of 25 ms was achieved for reference inputs with frequencies up to 1 Hz. This performance was maintained during prolonged continuous dynamic operation of several minutes, despite the great variation in the motor's dynamics due to the temperature effects (over a range 25 Â°C-45 Â°C) and modeling uncertainties.},

This paper presents a method that detects bearing faults and monitors the degradation of bearings in electric motors. Based on spectral kurtosis (SK) and cross correlation, the method extracts fault features that represent different faults, and the features are then combined to form a health index using principal component analysis (PCA) and a semisupervised k-nearest neighbor (KNN) distance measure. The method was validated by experiments using a machinery fault simulator and a computer cooling fan motor bearing. The method is able to detect incipient faults and diagnose the locations of faults under masking noise. It also provides a health index that tracks the degradation of faults without missing intermittent faults. Moreover, faulty reference data are not required.},

  Abstract                 = {Pole-phase modulation (PPM) is one of the effective speed and torque control techniques for multiphase induction motor (MIM) drives. Performance of the drive in low-pole high-speed mode for steady run is good even with two-level voltage excitation due to the inherent advantages of high phase number. The drive operation under high-pole high-torque starting mode suffers degradation in performance due to reduction in phase number in a way to increase number of poles. Extending conventional multilevel converter topologies for performance improvement of MIMs increases the device count and control complexity considerably. In this paper, a simple technique to generate multilevel voltage across the phase of a pole-phase-modulated induction motor (PPM IM), for improving the performance of the drive under high-pole operation is presented. The technique requires least changes in the control scheme and no additional switches for the power circuit. Exploiting the advantages of equal voltage profile coils (EVPCs) for carrier phase-shifted PWM control is the main focus of this paper. In addition, generalization of PPM is revisited in this paper to add a small constraint on the pole ratio to avoid unequal pole width for some pole-phase combinations. The effectiveness of the proposed scheme is shown through simulation with finite-element method (FEM) model of nine-phase squirrel cage induction motor and two-level nine-phase inverter cosimulated in Ansys Maxwell two-dimensional (2-D) and Simplorer environment. Experimental validation is also done on 5 hp nine-phase two-level induction motor drive controlled using Spartan6 FPGA board.},

  Abstract                 = {Lithium-ion capacitors (LICs) are a hybrid energy storage device combining the energy storage mechanisms of lithium-ion batteries (LIBs) and electric double-layer capacitors (EDLCs), and are considered attractive not only in high-power applications but also as an alternative to rechargeable batteries due to their inherent long cycle life and relatively high energy density. The cycle life testing was performed for commercial-off-the-shelf (COTS) LIC cells procured from three different manufactures, and the cycle life prediction model developed for EDLCs in the previous work was applied to LICs. Based on the resultant capacitance retention trends, the activation energies of degradation ratios were calculated using an Arrhenius equation, whereupon aging acceleration factors were determined. The calculated acceleration factors varied depending on manufacturers, suggesting that a proper aging acceleration factor should be determined for each manufacture cell based on cycle life testing rather than simply applying a rule of thumb which had been accepted for LIBs and EDLCs. The resulting and predicted capacitance retention trends correlated well, verifying that the cycle life prediction model established for EDLCs in the previous work would also be usable for LICs as an alternative to rechargeable batteries.},

  Abstract                 = {High-speed permanent-magnet synchronous machines (HS PMSMs) are a popular topology among modern electrical machines. Suitable applications for such machines are low-power vacuum pumps, compressors, and chillers. This paper describes a systematic design methodology for an HS PMSM using two case studies. The design process for such high-speed (HS) machines is multidisciplinary and highly iterative due to the complex interaction of the many design variables involved. Consequently, no single optimum solution exists, and multiple possible solutions can meet the customer requirements. Practical solutions should be within acceptable thermal limits, should be energy-efficient, and should be rigid enough to withstand the forces exerted during operation. The proposed design flow is divided into steps that are presented in this paper in the form of a flowchart with emphasis on mechanical aspects. Each step represents a task for a thermal, mechanical, or electrical engineer. The features of each step and the prerequisites for moving to the next step are discussed. The described methodology was implemented in the design of two HS PMSMs. The output performance results of the design flow are compared with measured results of the prototypes. The design process described in this paper provides a straightforward procedure for the multidisciplinary design of HS permanent magnet electrical machines.},

In particular, we present a formulation that includes the cost of the electricity exported/imported, the aging of the components, and the operational constraints. The control objective is to satisfy user demand, as well as extend the lifespan of expensive equipment, as is the case of the fuel cell or the electrolyzer. \mumbox{G} performance is investigated under realistic scenarios in three experiments. The experimental results illustrate how the proposed control system is able to manage the fuel cell and the electrolyzer through smooth power references, as well as to satisfy the power demanded. Finally, benchmarking is carried out between hysteresis band (HB) control and the proposed MPC in regard to efficiency and cost of the operation. The results obtained show that the MPC approach is more effective than HB for this type of \mumbox{G} , with a reduction in operation cost of up to 30%.},

  Abstract                 = {The success of electric vehicles (EVs) greatly depends on battery size, cost, lifetime, and capacity. The battery capacity of EVs has to contain enough energy to allow EV users to drive, at least, the minimum distance that internal combustion engine vehicles take. However, even with very efficient EVs and combining all the available highly efficient EV technologies, the battery capacity still needs to be large. Thus, one alternative to reduce the battery size is to improve the charging infrastructure by implementing sufficient public/private fast-charging locations, which will significantly increase the EV driving range with relatively low battery capacities. However, this kind of infrastructure requires charging with higher current capability, due to the high power levels involved in the fast-charging process. In this paper, a bidirectional dc/dc converter with six inverter legs connected to a three-phase output is proposed. The converter is similar to a three-phase dual-active-bridge (DAB) converter with more inverter legs in parallel. These additional inverter legs increase the converter current capability, without affecting the DAB main characteristics, preserving similar modulation techniques and DAB advantages. An accurate study about the proposed topology is carried out in this paper, and simulations and experimental results are shown for a 20-kW prototype, validating the theoretical analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {Partial discharge (PD) is the manifestation of insulation degradation, and it is regarded as a great risk in the field of industrial high-voltage insulation system. In this paper, the direction-of-arrival (DOA) estimation algorithm is used for the localization of partial-discharge source. The intersecting point of two rays, which come from two different directions measured by two uniform linear arrays (ULAs), can be regarded as the plane location of partial-discharge source. Fast rise times of partial-discharge pulses result in a wide electromagnetic spectrum, thus this paper focuses on the DOA estimation of wideband signals. The technique of multimodal joint sparse representation (MJSR) has been used to improve the performance of biometrics recognition. Here, we extend it to DOA estimation. The received data are represented by a sparse linear combination of potential steering vectors, while constraining the observations from different frequencies subject to sharing the same sparsity pattern. Based on the simultaneous orthogonal matching pursuit (SOMP) and alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM), a hard threshold algorithm is proposed for DOA estimation. In order to reduce the computational complexity of hard threshold algorithm, an improved soft threshold DOA estimation algorithm based on the ADMM is proposed as well. The effectiveness of the proposed algorithms is validated by simulations and real tests.},

The transducers are actuated by piezoelectric ceramics and decoupled with their connecting parts through novel flexure decoupling flanges. First, the initial geometric dimensions of the transducers were calculated using electromechanical equivalent method, then dynamic optimization design was carried out based on three-dimensional (3-D) finite element method (FEM), and the geometric dimensions of the transducer were finally determined. Flexure decoupling flanges were presented, and the decoupling principle of the flanges was explained through compliance modeling using compliance matrix method and FEM. After that the dynamic characteristics of the transducers were analyzed through finite element analysis (FEA). The vibration frequencies and modes of the piezoelectric converter, concentrators, and transducers were obtained through modal analysis, and the displacement nodes were determined. The longitudinal ultrasonic energy transmission was presented, and the decoupling effects of the flexure flanges were compared. Finally, the transducers were manufactured and experimental tests were conducted to examine the transducer characteristics using an impedance analyzer. The experimental results match well with the FEA. The results show that the longitudinal vibration frequencies of the transducers with ring, prismatic beam, and circular notched hinge-based flanges are 126.6, 125.8, and 125.52 kHz, respectively. The decoupling flange with circular notched hinges shows the best decoupling effect among the three types of flanges.},

  Abstract                 = {Offshore wind generation is an important trend of global wind power generation. To reduce the cost of energy of offshore wind generation, high-power direct-drive wind turbines are being pursued around the world. With the development of superconductors and related technologies, superconducting (SC) generator offers a possible technological approach to produce large-scale direct-drive wind turbines with a modest cost. A design of a SC wind generator (SCWG) for offshore direct-drive wind turbines is presented in this paper. The proposed SCWG is an electrically-excited synchronous generator with stationary field windings made of low temperature superconductor wires. The electromagnetic design considerations on SCWG are studied. The description on design of copper rotor and SC stator are presented. Several key design technologies including rotor cooling and supporting structure design, SC field winding design, and cryogenic refrigeration system for SC magnets are analyzed. The weight and cost of the proposed SCWG are estimated and compared with that of a permanent magnet wind generator (PMWG) design and several existing similar SCWG designs. It is found that the proposed SCWG is 46% lighter than the PMWG with the same specifications. Moreover, a rough estimation of material cost of the SCWG is carried out, and comparison analysis of cost is also performed.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper studies a single beacon-based three-dimensional multirobot localization (MRL) problem. Unlike most of existing localization algorithms which use extended Kalman filter or maximum a posteriori, moving horizon estimation (MHE), and convex optimization are novelly designed to perform MRL with constraints and unknown initial poses. The main contribution of this paper is three-fold: 1) a constrained MHE-based localization algorithm, which can bound localization error, impose various constraints and compromise between computational complexity and estimator accuracy, is proposed to estimate robot poses; 2) constrained optimization is examined in the perspective of Fisher information matrix to analyze why and how multirobot information and constraints are able to reduce uncertainties; 3) a semidefinite programming-based initial pose estimation, which can efficiently converge to global optimum, is developed by using convex relaxation. Simulations and experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed methods.},

At operation layer, a nonlinear model predictive control (NMPC) strategy is proposed to stabilize the upper operation layer system. Then by considering the effect of radial basis function (RBF) performance index and random packet dropout phenomena, a predictive compensator is designed to guarantee the input-to-state practical stability (ISpS) of the resulting system. In addition, networked flotation processes are considered in the simulation part, and the simulation results further demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Thus, the conventional maximum power point tracking (MPPT) method is not acceptable either on tracking accuracy or on tracking speed. In this paper, two global MPPT methods, namely, the searchâskipâjudge global MPPT (SSJ-GMPPT) and rapid global MPPT (R-GMPPT) methods are proposed in terms of reducing the searching voltage range based on comprehensive study of \Im box{--}V and Pmbox{--}V characteristics of PV string. The SSJ-GMPPT method can track the real maximum power point under any shading conditions and achieve high accuracy and fast tracking speed without additional circuits and sensors. The R-GMPPT method aims to enhance the tracking speed of long string with vast PV modules and reduces more than 90% of the tracking time that is consumed by the conventional global searching method. The improved performance of the two proposed methods has been validated by experimental results on a PV string. The comparison with other methods highlights the two proposed methods more powerful.},

  Abstract                 = {A soft-switching bidirectional dc-dc converter (BDC) with a coupled-inductor and a voltage doubler cell is proposed for high step-up/step-down voltage conversion applications. A dual-active half-bridge (DAHB) converter is integrated into a conventional buck-boost BDC to extend the voltage gain dramatically and decrease switch voltage stresses effectively. The coupled inductor operates not only as a filter inductor of the buck-boost BDC, but also as a transformer of the DAHB converter. The input voltage of the DAHB converter is shared with the output of the buck-boost BDC. So, PWM control can be adopted to the buck-boost BDC to ensure that the voltage on the two sides of the DAHB converter is always matched. As a result, the circulating current and conduction losses can be lowered to improve efficiency. Phase-shift control is adopted to the DAHB converter to regulate the power flows of the proposed BDC. Moreover, zero-voltage switching (ZVS) is achieved for all the active switches to reduce the switching losses. The operational principles and characteristics of the proposed BDC are presented in detail. The analysis and performance have been fully validated experimentally on a 40-60 V/400 V 1-kW hardware prototype.},

  Abstract                 = {The electrical and acoustic characteristics of a two-layered piezoelectric transducer in a broad frequency range are investigated. The theoretical modeling of the transducer having dual oppositely polarized lead magnesium-lead titanate (PMN-PT) layers based upon KLM equivalent circuit theory with the complex piezoelectric material constants is reported. The complex material constants of the piezoelectric single crystal including the frequency-dependent loss properties are obtained by fitting the measured electrical impedance resonance characteristics. The electrical impedance and surface vibration displacement characteristics at frequencies up to the third harmonic of the two-layered piezoelectric transducers with various layer thicknesses are studied by simulation and measurement. It is found that the nonuniformity of the two active layer thicknesses promotes the second harmonic of the electrical and acoustic frequency characteristics, which can be optimized to extend the bandwidth of multilayer piezoelectric transducers. The reported model with the complex piezoelectric material constants can predict the electrical impedance of the multilayer piezoelectric transducers with the agreement functions above 69% and the characteristic frequency errors below 3.03% over the frequency range covering the first three harmonics. The predicted harmonic frequency errors of the acoustic output are less than 6.8%. This work fundamentally supports the design and optimization improvement of multilayer piezoelectric ultrasonic transducers for wide frequency range applications.},

The scheme includes two components, namely a continuous control component and a switching control component. The continuous control component is employed with model reference adaptive control (MRAC) to approximate the parametric uncertainties, and the switching control component is used with integral sliding-mode control (ISMC) to eliminate the general disturbance caused by both the approximation errors and the unstructured uncertainties. Due to the variation in general disturbance in different operating conditions, a switching-gain adaptation method based on the unknown disturbance estimation is proposed, which improves the transient performance of the current controller and eliminates the high-frequency noise of current caused by chattering. Finally, the effectiveness of the proposed method is verified by experimental results.},

The flatness of the linear model is proved and a flat output is found. An equivalent form of the model is obtained based on the flat output and its derivatives only.

In this paper, a new overmodulation method based on indirect SVPWM is presented.

By simplifying the CM noise equivalent circuit based on Thevenin's theorem, the equivalent noise source (ENS) for CM noise is proposed. The ENS is expressed by a linear combination of voltages in the converter, where the coefficients of these voltages are determined by transformer winding structure and the circuit configuration. With the help of ENS, the CM noise of the converter under different circuit configuration can be systematically analyzed and conveniently compared, which develops an effective reference for selecting a proper circuit configuration.

A popular monitoring method as it has been, the partial least squares (PLS) algorithm is sensitive to outliers in training datasets, and cannot efficiently distinguish faults related to KPI from those unrelated to KPI due to its oblique projection to the input space. In this paper, a novel robust data-driven approach, named advanced partial least squares (APLS), is presented to handle process outliers under an improved framework of PLS. By means of a weighting strategy, APLS can remove the impact of outliers on process measurements and establish a more accurate model than PLS for fault diagnosis in the monitoring scheme, whose effectiveness has been verified through the Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process.

Then, the rotor position estimation is fulfilled via enabling the zero-sequence carrier voltage to zero. Compared with conventional rotating injection using zero-sequence voltage, the proposed strategy is simpler for signal demodulation and more robust to signal processing delays due to the fact that it is amplitude modulated by machine saliency and phase shifts of saliency position due to signal processing delays are intrinsically cancelled, which is the same as the classical pulsating injection in the estimated synchronous reference frame with carrier current sensing. Therefore, the proposed method can combine the synergies of zero-sequence method (i.e., high bandwidth and stability) and pulsating injection (i.e., increased accuracy and fast dynamic response). Furthermore, the cross-coupling magnetic saturation effects on zero-sequence voltage sensing-based sensorless control are discussed in detail. All the theoretical analyses are validated by experiments on a laboratory surface-mounted PM (SPM) machine.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the influence of asymmetric machine parameters on carrier signal injection-based sensorless control of permanent-magnet synchronous machines (PMSMs). With either rotating or pulsating signal injection, the second harmonic position errors arise due to the parameter asymmetry. Furthermore, it is found that for the two carriers, the second harmonic errors are different for resistance asymmetry but the same for inductance asymmetry. In order to suppress the position errors, the carrier signal selection guidelines are discussed for resistance asymmetry, while for inductance asymmetry, novel online compensation strategies with dual-frequency injection are also proposed. Finally, the theoretical analyses and proposed compensation methods are validated by experiments on an interior PM (IPM) machine with added phase resistance/inductance to simulate asymmetric conditions.},

  Abstract                 = {For a class of nonspherical-wrist manipulators, i.e., redundant or nonredundant, we propose unified singularity analysis and computation-effective avoidance methods. First, we construct a unified model to describe this class of manipulators and derive the kinematics equation and its modified form. Second, the Jacobian matrix of an n -degree-of-freedom (DOF) manipulator is partitioned into block triangle form, and the singularity conditions are isolated and collected in a 3\times(n-3) submatrix. By analyzing the rank degeneracy conditions of the submatrix, singularity configurations are identified. Third, based on the partitioned Jacobian matrix, the kinematics equation is decomposed into two smaller dimension subequations, only one of which (called singular subequation, as determined by the 3\times(n-3) submatrix) contains singularities. Finally, reduced-order approaches and the singularity parameter optimization (SPO) method are presented to plan the singularity-free trajectories by handling the singular subequation. Theoretical analysis shows that the computation costs of the reduced-order approaches are only 1/3â1/2 of the traditional methods. The SPO method is even more efficient than the reduced-order methods. Simulation results verify the proposed methods.},

  Abstract                 = {Commutations existing in a brushless dc motor (BLDCM) drive system not only aggravate the torque ripple and reduce the power factor but also cause the catastrophic failure of a sensorless drive based on the zero-crossing detection of back electromotive force when the commutation duration approaches or exceeds 30 electrical degrees. For a sensorless BLDCM drive system with a long commutation time, it is necessary to shorten the commutation time. In this paper, a technique making the commutation time significantly reduced by means of a novel inverter topology is presented. The proposed topology is based on the idea of supplying higher dc-link voltage for the freewheeling phase. First, the dc link of the backward freewheeling path is decoupled from that of the forward energy flow path. The superiority of dc-link decoupling for commutation control is analyzed. Then, in order to provide adjustable voltage higher than the dc source voltage for the dc link of the freewheeling path, a double-layer C-dump converter is proposed. Compared with the traditional unipolar C-dump converter, it not only upraises the potential of the positive rail but also lowers the potential of the negative rail. Finally, the proposed inverter topology is verified by simulation and experimental results.},

  Abstract                 = {Traditional fault diagnosis and prognosis (FDP) approaches are based on periodic sampling, i.e., samples are taken and algorithms are executed both in a periodic manner. As the volume of sensor data and complexity of algorithms keep increasing, the bottleneck of FDP is mainly the limited computational resources, which is particularly true for distributed applications where FDP functions are deployed on microcontrollers and embedded systems with limited computation resources. This paper introduces the concept of Lebesgue sampling (LS) in FDP and proposes a LS-based FDP (LS-FDP) framework. In the proposed LS-FDP, a novel diagnostic philosophy of âexecution only when necessaryâ is developed in computation cost reduction. For prognosis, different from traditional approaches in which the prognostic horizon is on the time axis, the proposed approach defines the prognostic horizon on the fault state axis. With a reduced prognostic horizon, the LS-FDP naturally benefits the uncertainty management. The goal of this paper is to create the fundamental knowledge for LS-FDP solutions that are cost efficient, capable for the deployment on systems with limited computation sources, and supportive to the trend of distributed FDP schemes in complex systems. The design and implementation of particle-filter-based LS-FDP are presented with experimental results on lithium-ion batteries to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches.},

By controlling the steering, the motorcycle can self balance by keeping its wheels swaying. Furthermore, three different steering modes of the motorcycle were discussed. A brief comparison about these modes was shown through several experiments. In order to achieve a full-speed range self-balancing motorcycle system, two different phase modes were applied in zero/low speed and normal/high speed, respectively.

  Abstract                 = {Many industries have a growing awareness in utilizing new technologies to improve the reliability and availability of their systems. Prognostics, a subject concerned with the prediction of the remaining useful life (RUL), has been increasingly studied and applied to practical systems, such as electrical systems, over the past few years. Here, with the adoption of a data-driven prognostics framework, this paper proposed a health index (HI)-based prognostics method to predict the RUL of electrical machines. By assuming a linearly degrading HI over time, the proposed method predicts the RUL in two steps: 1) from input signals to HI; and then 2) mapping HI to RUL. The novelty of this method lies in the proposed dynamic HI smoothing approach where three characteristics of HI, namely monotonicity, gradualness, and consistency, are incorporated to smooth the current HI values with the previously predicted ones. Real data collected from eight electrical motors, subjected to accelerated thermal aging process, were used in the experimental studies, with the results showing the superiority of the proposed HI-based RUL prediction over the traditional direct RUL prediction (i.e., without HI).},

  Abstract                 = {Sparse representation (SR)-based tracking systems have become popular in the past recent years for its effectiveness. However, the underlying assumption of these tracking systems is that the target appearance can be linearly represented by a sparse approximation over a set of templates and a residual term, which usually needs to solve â1 norm minimization for many times and brings a heavy computational cost. This paper introduces an efficient tracking system by discovering orthogonalized templates. By orthogonalizing templates from previous frames and removing their correlation, we show that the sparsity of template weights is not necessary in target appearance modeling and thus a least squares regularization can be employed. We also decompose the residual term into two components in observation model to take occlusion cases into consideration. We demonstrate that, in comparison with the SR-based tracking systems that use â1 learning, our tracking system is much more computationally efficient while getting an even better performance. Experiments on a variety of challenging video sequences demonstrate both the effectiveness and efficiency of the system.},

  Abstract                 = {A three-phase single-switch discontinuous conduction mode (DCM) boost power factor correction (PFC) converter features zero-current turn on for the switch, no reverse recovery in the diode, a constant-switching-frequency operation, a simple control, and a low cost, which are suitable for low-to-medium-power and cost-sensitive applications. Due to the DCM, the energy transfer does not cover the whole switching cycle, the rms and peak values of the inductor current are large, and those of the switch and the diode are also large. This increases not only the current stress of the power components but also the conduction and switching turn-off losses, which lower the efficiency of the converter. An optimum utilization control of switching cycles is proposed in this paper to increase the critical boost inductance. The rms and peak current values of the main power components are reduced, and the conduction and switching turn-off losses are therefore decreased, leading to higher efficiency. The proposed method also slightly achieves an output voltage ripple reduction, and the input current harmonics comply with the standard of the International Electrotechnical Commission 61000-3-2 Class A.},

  Abstract                 = {A conventional asymmetrical half-bridge (AHB) converter is widely used for dc-dc stage in low-to-medium power system. However, since the asymmetric operation of AHB converter causes the low efficiency over entire load condition, the conventional AHB converter is not usually considered for the candidate of server power system. In order to overcome the problems of the conventional AHB converter, a wide zero-voltage-switching (ZVS) range AHB converter with a clamp switch and a clamp diode is proposed in this paper. The proposed AHB converter (PAHBC) replaces a low-side clamp diode with a MOSFET switch and adds an auxiliary winding, which changes the transformer turns-ratio. From these modifications and the pulsewidth-modulation (PWM) control of clamp switch, the PAHBC can be designed optimally at nominal input condition and obtains additional dc gain at hold-up time condition. These advantages achieve the high conversion efficiency over the entire load condition. The operational principle and analysis of the PAHBC are presented in this paper and verified by a 340-400 V input and 50 V/500 W output laboratory prototype.},

This paper presents a multi-objective bacterial foraging optimization (MOBFO) algorithm to find optimal solutions that maximize the current efficiency and minimize the energy consumption and the production of perfluorocarbons (PFCs). Our method can be viewed as an enhanced version of the bacterial foraging optimization (BFO) in solving multi-objective optimization (MOO) problems (MOPs). We first propose a task-oriented optimization framework and model, and then parallel cell entropy and its difference are introduced to evaluate the evolutionary status of the Pareto solutions in a new objective space called parallel cell coordinate system (PCCS). In particular, the Pareto-archived evolution approach (PAEA) and the adaptive foraging strategy (AFS) are applied to balance the convergence and diversity of the Pareto front in the optimization procedure. Compared with traditional approaches, MOBFO not only increases speed of convergence toward the Pareto front, but also improves the diversity of the obtained solutions. Extensive experiment results on numerous benchmark problems and real-world aluminum electrolysis production process validated our proposed method's effectiveness.},

Then, optimization objective function on the comprehensive index Ï, the squared prediction error (SPE), and Hotelling's T-squared (T2) statistics are established. Furthermore, bacterial foraging algorithm is applied to obtain the optimized operator to facilitate extracting the representative principal components.

  Abstract                 = {It is well known that predictive control methods can be affected by the presence of modeling errors. The extent to which finite-control-set model predictive control (FCS-MPC) is influenced by parametric uncertainties is a recurrent concern at the moment of evaluating the viability of this method for power electronics applications. This paper proposes an analytic approach to examine the influence of model parametric uncertainties on the prediction error of FCS-MPC for current control in a three-phase two-level inverter. The analysis shows that the prediction error is not only determined by parametric mismatch but also by the instantaneous values of load current and inverter output voltage. This implies that within each sampling period of the predictive algorithm several conditions of prediction error are generated, as multiple voltage vectors are evaluated. Simulation and experimental results are provided and discussed showing the effects of inaccuracies in the modeling of load resistance and inductance parameters on the performance of FCS-MPC. Even though steady-state performance is noticeably affected with parameter changes, especially when the load inductance is overestimated by the model, its fast transient step response is less affected by parameter changes.},

With full consideration of both mechanical configuration and propulsive principle of a physical robot comprising one neck joint, two propulsive joints, and a pair of two-degrees-of-freedom (2-DOF) mechanical flippers, closed-loop pitch, roll, yaw, and depth control methods are integrated to accomplish precise attitude control. Specifically, two pitch control strategies are proposed to separately satisfy small and large pitch requirements based on the real-time feedback of the pitch angle, while the roll controller is further implemented as a proportional-integral-derivative (PID) loop. A combination of pitch and roll control is utilized to regulate the desired pitch maneuvers. Finally, a parameterized five-phase leaping control algorithm instead of Weihs's three-phase porpoising model is implemented on the self-contained real robot, enabling the examination of biological leaping phenomena which are hard to observe or measure. Latest experimental results reveal that besides high speeds exceeding the minimum exit speeds, the pitch control closely related to pitch angle and submersion depth is another critical factor contributing to effective dolphin leaping.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is concerned with the coordination control of multiple biomimetic robotic fish in highly dynamic aquatic environments by building a hybrid centralized system. With the aid of the results of biorobotics and control techniques, a radio-controlled multijoint robotic fish and its locomotion control are developed. To enable a closed control loop, a visual subsystem that is responsible for tracking of multiple moving objects is constructed and implemented in real time. Furthermore, a behavior-based hierarchical architecture in conjunction with fuzzy reinforcement learning is proposed to accomplish effective coordination among multiple swimming robots. Finally, experiments on 2vs2 water polo game are carried out to verify the proposed coordination control scheme. Over the past eight years, this multirobot platform has been successfully applied to international underwater robot competitions to promote innovative research and education in underwater robotics.},

The designed control law is distributed in the sense that the controller of each follower vehicle only uses its own information and the information of its neighboring vehicles.

Unlike symmetric conditions, the fundamental ac current is not split equally between the upper and lower arms under asymmetric conditions and the dc and double-frequency components in the common-mode current also flow into the ac side. To solve these issues, a theoretical analysis of the effect of asymmetric conditions on MMC operation is carried out using equivalent circuits at different frequencies. Three control targets are then presented to enhance the operational performance. A control strategy providing the control of differential-mode current, common-mode current and power balance is designed. The feasibility and validity of the proposed analysis and control strategy are demonstrated by simulation results from a three-phase MMC system and simulation and experimental results from a single-phase MMC system.},

The effects of the space vector modulation approaches on the capacitor current are investigated. Based on the analytical results, the method introducing the smaller capacitor current is selected as the optimized modulation approach, which is of paramount importance to avoid the permanent failure of the dc-link capacitors. Then, with the optimized modulation approach, a control-oriented model for the post-fault PWM rectifiers is derived based on the Î± - Î² stationary frame, where the capacitor voltage oscillation and deviation are taken into account. The proposed model-based controllers do not require the phase-locked loop (PLL), and the elimination of the PLL means that the post-fault rectifiers can never lose synchronization with the grid. Furthermore, an equation of the required dc voltage for linear modulation is proposed, and using the proposed equation, a correct dc voltage is selected to reject the overmodulation. The experimental results validate the effectiveness of the proposed comprehensive design and optimization. Finally, a conclusion can be drawn from the experimental results-that the dc-link capacitor current and the linear modulation should be taken into account when selecting the dc voltage in the post-fault operation.},

This is mostly due to the high axial force between the stator and the two rotors, which can be further increased by the inevitable manufacturing and assembly tolerances. Based on the determined geometric dimensions of the electromagnetically relevant components, a reliable mechanical construction is developed in this paper. Subsequently, stress, deformation, thermal, and modal analyses are performed based on finite-element method (FEM). Finally, the first prototype is successfully manufactured and measured.

When a hybrid excitation is applied, postfault armature currents can be reduced by applying a positive field current (PFC). Hence, in this paper, based on both 2-D and 3-D finite-element analyses (FEAs), two six-phase hybrid-excited flux-switching (HEFS) machines with E-core and C-core stator laminations are designed, respectively. Iron bridges are adopted in each machine, and the influences on the performance are investigated. In addition, alternative-tooth-wound armature windings are employed in the C-core machine to obtain physical and magnetic isolations between armature phases. A comprehensive comparison of the two designs is carried out. Then, more attention is paid to fault-tolerant operating capabilities when an open-circuit fault occurs to only one phase and two phases of armature windings, respectively. The PFC can be applied in the C-core machine under fault-tolerant operating conditions; thus, the postfault armature current can be reduced while maintaining the torque output. Overall, the torque output can be effectively maintained in each HEFS machine during postfault operations. Finally, the FEA-based studies are validated by experimental measurements on two HEFS machine prototypes.},

The harmonic fluctuations in the position estimation error caused by inverter nonlinearities and flux spatial harmonics are analyzed. Accordingly, a newly proposed multiple-AVF CFN with an easy-to-implement structure is adopted to detect and compensate the back-EMF harmonic distortions and, hence, to eliminate the position error harmonic fluctuations. Consequently, the position estimation accuracy can be enhanced, which improves the position sensorless control performance. The proposed scheme was verified on a 2.2-kW sensorless IPMSM drive.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a robust adaptive iterative learning control (ILC) algorithm for 3-DOF permanent magnet (PM) spherical actuators to improve their trajectory tracking performance. The dynamic model of a PM spherical actuator is a multivariable nonlinear system with interaxis coupling terms. Uncertainties such as modeling errors, loads, and external disturbances exist in the model unavoidably, which will affect the performance, including the precision of the control system. Hence, to compensate for these uncertainties, a new hybrid control scheme that consists of a proportionalâderivative (PD) feedback control with varying gains, a PD-type ILC with adjustable gains, and a robust term is developed. The new control law combines the advantages of simplicity and easy design of the PD control, the effectiveness of the ILC to handle model uncertainties and repetitive disturbances, and the robustness of the robust term to random disturbances. In addition, to expedite the convergence rate, the gains in the PD feedback control and the PD-type ILC are adaptively adjusted according to the iteration times. It is shown that the system tracking error approaches zero as the number of iterations increases. To demonstrate the proposed algorithm and verify the established theoretical results, both simulations and experiments are conducted. The results have shown that the proposed control algorithm can effectively compensate for various uncertainties and can thus improve the trajectory tracking performance of spherical actuators.},

  Abstract                 = {Hysteresis model predictive control (HMPC) is a variant of finite-control-set model predictive control, which is mainly developed for high-power applications. In this paper, the HMPC scheme is proposed to control a high-power grid-connected two-level voltage source inverter with an inductive-capacitive-inductive (LCL) filter. To ensure the stable operation of the control system, the resonance characteristics of the system with an LCL filter based on HMPC are analyzed, and an active damping scheme is then given. On the other hand, the impacts of the modeling error on system stability and average switching frequency are analyzed in detail. Then, a new switching frequency-adaptive control scheme that uses the average switching frequency to adjust the parameter value of the predictive model online is presented. The new control scheme can keep the average switching frequency within an acceptable operational margin, while improving the stability of the control system. For demonstration, the proposed control scheme has been implemented on a small-scale grid-connected inverter system, and the results show that the theoretical analysis is correct and that the proposed control scheme is effective.},

The proposed configuration of the axial displacement sensor consists of three probes: one pair is used to eliminate the synchronous measuring error, and the third probe is employed for the consideration of temperature drift. First, the generating mechanism of the synchronous measuring error caused by the improper assemble is presented, and an operational amplifier is proposed to obtain an accurate position of the axial center by adjusting the weights of sensing signals from one pair of probes. Then the scheme of temperature compensation using an auxiliary probe is presented. In order to obtain accurately the characteristics of temperature drift at the operating point, the detailed procedure is given to determine the temperature-drift ratio. Finally, the terms related to temperature drift and synchronous error in the final output of the displacement sensor are both eliminated.

As a result, the design of FDF can be formulated as an Hi/Hâ optimization problem such that a sensitivity/robustness ratio criterion is maximized. To further improve its robustness, simultaneous FD with disturbance estimation and compensation is considered.

When supplied by a common dc bus, the open-winding PMSG system can be more simplified. Because the voltage output by the diode converter is decided by the three-phase current polarity, the available voltage vector modulation range of the voltage source converter is limited. As a result, the current zero-crossing duration behavior is determined by the power factor angle, which will lead to zero-crossing voltage pulse disturbance, serious electromagnetic interference, and unexpected diode switching loss. This paper aims to reduce the current zero-crossing duration by injecting the third harmonic current into the zero-sequence current. A proportional resonant regulator is proposed to control the zero-sequence current. Finally, the proposed method is validated in a 1-kW semicontrolled open-winding PMSG experimental system.},

Once a fault is detected, how to investigate the root causes of the fault by isolating the true faulty variables without any historical fault information is a challenging problem. Inspired by the idea of the contribution analysis (CA) methods developed in the frame of the principal component analysis (PCA), in this paper, a novel isolation index will be provided by decomposing the kNN distance used as the detection index in kNN-based fault detection method. The commonly used CA-based isolation methods suffer from smearing effect due to the correlation among the defined isolation indices, thus prone to misdiagnosis. The proposed isolation index is defined in the original measurement space without correlation. Moreover, theoretical analysis of the isolability for the proposed fault isolation method shows that it can isolate multiple sensor faults under a less strict condition than that used in the analysis of those CA-based fault isolation methods. The numerical examples and Tennessee Eastman (TE) benchmark process are used to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  Abstract                 = {The internal model control (IMC) has been widely attended for its simple structure and easy realization. Its control performance has a relationship with the filter time constant directly, so that its application of high performance is influenced in the application of motor drive system. A novel method of two-degree-of-freedom (2DOF) IMC strategy of induction motors (IMs) using the immune algorithm (IA) is proposed in this paper. The IA is studied on the basis of the immune response system and the algorithm realization is analyzed. The IA is introduced into the 2DOF IMC, and the filter time constant adjustment online is realized by taking full advantage of the adaptivity of the IA. The simulation and experimental results verify the effectiveness of 2DOF IMC strategy of the IM using the IA.},

  Abstract                 = {In rotary ultrasonic grinding (RUG), a rotating transformer can be used to replace the established slip ring technology and provide a contactless power supply to the revolving transducer. Such contactless energy transfer (CET) is safe, and high rotation speeds are possible. Compared with a closely coupled transformer, the transfer efficiency of the rotating transformer is lower. Compensation of the windings is necessary to improve efficiency. In addition, the cutting force in RUG is not constant; this will influence the power transfer performance, which in turn affects the vibration amplitude of the tool. In this paper, by considering the distinct capacitive and mechanical behavior of the transducer and the equivalent series resistances (ESRs) of the compensation elements, mathematical models are developed to identify the transfer efficiency and the output power of the rotating transformer. A general mathematical compensation model is developed for maximum transfer efficiency. The effects of the cutting force on the transfer efficiency, the output power, and the power factor are also researched. The experimental results basically agree with the calculated results. A CET system that can produce high efficiency, a high power factor and adaptive output power that adapts to the variations of cutting force in the RUG is therefore possible.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper investigates the problem of distributed Hâ filtering for a class of discrete-time Markov jump Lur'e systems over sensor networks with stochastic switching topologies. As a first effort, the redundant channels are considered to use in the data transmission to strive against the fragility of networks commonly configured by a single channel in the communication networks subject to quantization and randomly occurring packet dropouts. By constructing a Lur'e-type Lyapunov function interconnected with a cone-bounded nonlinearity, the filtering performance analysis for the underlying systems is carried out first. Then, a new class of distributed filters, which can be used to reflect the mismatching characteristic of modes jumping between the target plants and the proposed filters, is designed such that the filtering error system is stochastically stable and achieves a prescribed average Hâ performance index. A numerical example is provided to show the effectiveness of the proposed filtering scheme.},

  Abstract                 = {The control of boost-derived converters presents a special challenge due to its non-minimum phase behavior, forcing a slow transient response when traditional linear techniques are employed. In order to improve the dynamic behavior, more complex controllers have been proposed (e.g., adaptive, nonlinear, boundary, etc.), but the improvements introduced by each one of them cannot be objectively assessed in the absence of a theoretical performance limit standard reference. This work introduces a benchmarking tool based on the evaluation of the converters' performance under start-up, load current, and input voltage step-up/step-down transients. Six performance indices are defined using the theoretical performance limits as reference. In this way, the converters' dynamic performance can be quantitatively assessed in six different aspects, enabling a thorough benchmarking procedure. The ideal parameters are found by exploring the performance limits of boost converters, providing valuable insight into the behavior of the topology. These reference parameters are found in a normalized domain and characterized by closed-form expressions, providing simple, intuitive, and general results valid for any combination of LC parameters and voltage levels. The characterization of the dynamic performance limits is validated by experimental results. The proposed benchmarking procedure is illustrated by evaluating the dynamic performance of two different dc-dc boost converters.},
