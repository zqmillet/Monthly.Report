  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes an offering strategy for a wind power producer (WPP) that participates in both day-ahead (DA) and balancing oligopoly markets as a price maker. Penetration of demand response (DR) resources into smart grids is modeled by intraday demand response exchange (IDRX) architecture. A bilevel optimization framework is proposed based on multiagent system and incomplete information game theory. Modeling the WPPs in high penetration of wind power as price makers can reflect the capability of this market player to directly affect the market prices. Simulation results indicate that the price-taker model of WPP is not accurate for WPPs that have significant market shares. By comparing the results obtained from modeling the WPPs as price makers with the ones as price takers, it can be concluded that WPPs have the market power not only to increase the prices of both DA and balancing markets, but also to reduce the amount of DR through IDRX market mechanism.},

  Abstract                 = {Programmable logic controllers (PLCs) are embedded computers widely used in industrial control systems. Ensuring that a PLC software complies with its specification is a challenging task. Formal verification has become a recommended practice to ensure the correctness of safety-critical software, but is still underused in industry due to the complexity of building and managing formal models of real applications. In this paper, we propose a general methodology to perform automated model checking of complex properties expressed in temporal logics [e.g., computation tree logic (CTL) and linear temporal logic (LTL)] on PLC programs. This methodology is based on an intermediate model (IM) meant to transform PLC programs written in various standard languages [structured text (ST), sequential function chart (SFC), etc.] to different modeling languages of verification tools. We present the syntax and semantics of the IM, and the transformation rules of the ST and SFC languages to the nuXmv model checker passing through the IM. Finally, two real cases studies of the European Organization for Nuclear Research (CERN) PLC programs, written mainly in the ST language, are presented to illustrate and validate the proposed approach.},

In this paper, a novel design method for distributed maximum power point tracking (DMPPT) synchronous boost converter is proposed. The method is based on nondominated sorting genetic algorithm with the aim to obtain the best synchronous rectification (SR) boost topology while considering different targets such as converter efficiency and reliability maximization, as well as converter price minimization. New weighted indices are also proposed for a more realistic characterization of the devices.},

  Abstract                 = {Wafer defects, which are primarily defective chips on a wafer, are of the key challenges facing the semiconductor manufacturing companies, as they could increase the yield losses to hundreds of millions of dollars. Fortunately, these wafer defects leave unique patterns due to their spatial dependence across wafer maps. It is thus possible to identify and predict them in order to find the point of failure in the manufacturing process accurately. This paper introduces a novel simplified subspaced regression framework for the accurate and efficient identification of defect patterns in semiconductor wafer maps. It can achieve a test error comparable to or better than the state-of-the-art machine-learning (ML)-based methods, while maintaining a low computational cost when dealing with large-scale wafer data. The effectiveness and utility of the proposed approach has been demonstrated by our experiments on real wafer defect datasets, achieving detection accuracy of 99.884% and R2 of 99.905%, which are far better than those of any existing methods reported in the literature.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a multiobjective probabilistic model for the placement of phasor measurement units (PMUs) in electrical power networks. The proposed model simultaneously optimizes two objectives functions: 1) minimizes the number of PMUs; and 2) maximizes the expected value of system's redundancy (or minimizes the unobservability of the system). Incorporating the impact of zero-injection buses, an efficient formulation is used to evaluate the probability of unobservability of buses resulted from line outages and PMU loss. The extracted formulation is based on the mixed integer linear programming (MILP) framework, which is efficiently solvable by high-performance commercial solvers. This multiobjective optimization problem (MOP) is solved by augmented epsilon-constraint and weighting approach. Accordingly, two new indices are introduced to compare these two multiobjective methods. Finally, the ultimate solution among the Pareto front is recognized using a fuzzy decision-making process. The IEEE 57-bus test system is used to examine the effectiveness of the proposed frameworks.},

As an illustrative example, the proposed switched MPC is applied to a flying capacitor converter. As evidenced by experimental results, the proposed control strategy provides quick disturbance compensation, while giving excellent steady-state performance.},

  Abstract                 = {For a photovoltaic (PV) system, it is widely assumed that the peaks of a partially shaded P-V curve are located at the multiples of 0.8Voc, where Voc is the open-circuit voltage of the PV module. However, this assumption - known as the of 0.8Voc model for partial shading - is not necessarily true. If the same model is used to design the maximum power point tracker (MPPT), it is very likely that the algorithm will scan the wrong region of the P-V curve and, hence, an incorrect global peak detection. This paper attempts to prove the inadequacy of the 0.8Voc model when the number of modules in the string increases. Further, the work suggests a simple relationship to predict the correct position of the peaks. It is found that for a string of 20 modules (Voc of 400 V), the maximum deviation between the actual and computed peak is less than 3 V, while for the 0.8Voc model, the deviation reaches up to 50 V. In addition, using the proposed method, the MPPT efficiency can be improved by approximately 2%.},

  Abstract                 = {The evolution of the electrical grid into a smart grid, allowing user production, storage, and exchange of energy; remote control of appliances; and, in general, optimizations over how the energy is managed and consumed, is an evolution into a complex information and communication technology (ICT) system. With the goal of promoting an integrated and interoperable smart grid, a number of organizations all over the world started uncoordinated standardization activities, which caused the emergence of a large number of incompatible architectures and standards. There are now new standardization activities that have the goal of organizing existing standards and produce best practices to choose the right approach(es) to be employed in specific smart grid designs. This paper follows the lead of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) and the European Telecommunications Standards Institute/European Committee for Standardization/European Committee for Electrotechnical Standardization (ETSI/CEN/CENELEC) approaches in trying to provide taxonomy of existing solutions; our contribution reviews and relates current ICT state of the art with the objective of forecasting future trends based on the orientation of current efforts and on relationships between them. The resulting taxonomy provides guidelines for further studies of the architectures, and highlights how the standards in the last mile of the smart grid are converging to common solutions to improve ICT infrastructure interoperability.},

This paper presents a stochastic programming framework for conducting optimal 24-h scheduling of CHP-based MGs consisting of wind turbine, fuel cell, boiler, a typical power-only unit, and energy storage devices. The objective of scheduling is to find the optimal set points of energy resources for profit maximization considering demand response programs and uncertainties. The impact of the wind speed, market, and MG load uncertainties on the MG scheduling problem is characterized through a stochastic programming formulation. This paper studies three cases to confirm the performance of the proposed model. The effect of CHP-based MG scheduling in the islanded and grid-connected modes, as well as the effectiveness of applying the proposed DR program is investigated in the case studies.},

  Abstract                 = {Well known as an efficient and eco-friendly power source, fuel cell, unfortunately, offers slow dynamics. When attached as primary energy source in a vehicle, fuel cell would not be able to respond to abrupt load variations. Supplementing battery and/or supercapacitor to the system will provide a solution to this shortcoming. On the other hand, a current regulation that is vital for lengthening time span of the energy storage system is needed. This can be accomplished by keeping fuel cell's and batteries' current slope in reference to certain values, as well as attaining a stable dc output voltage. For that purpose, a feedback control system for regulating the hybrid of fuel cell, batteries, and supercapacitor was constructed for this study. Output voltage of the studied hybrid power sources (HPS) was administered by assembling three dc-dc converters comprising two bidirectional converters and one boost converter. Current/voltage output of fuel cell was regulated by boost converter, whereas the bidirectional converters regulated battery and supercapacitor. Reference current for each converter was produced using Model Predictive Control (MPC) and subsequently tracked using hysteresis control. These functions were done on a controller board of a dSPACE DS1104. Subsequently, on a test bench made up from 6 V, 4.5 Ah battery and 7.5 V, 120 F supercapacitor together with a fuel cell of 50 W, 10 A, experiment was conducted. Results show that constructing a control system to restrict fuel cell's and batteries' current slope and maintaining dc bus voltage in accordance with the reference values using MPC was feasible and effectively done.},

  Abstract                 = {The IPv6 routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (RPL) has been recently standardized by the Internet Engineering Task Force (IETF) routing protocol for low-power and lossy networks (ROLL) working group to support IPv6 routing for resource-constrained devices in industrial, home, and urban environments. However, several studies have shown that RPL may experience (very) low delivery rates, particularly in large-scale deployments. In this paper, we provide an in-depth analysis of the protocol attributes and design choices that generate such unreliability issues. Then, we describe and evaluate a new implementation of the RPL standard for the Contiki operating system (OS) to improve data delivery reliability. The salient feature of our RPL implementation is to adopt a flexible cross-layering design that provides simple routing optimizations, enhanced link estimation capabilities, and efficient management of neighbor tables. In order to verify the effectiveness of our RPL implementation, we use an advanced metering infrastructure (AMI) as a case study. Results obtained using Cooja emulator in two sets of experiments, differentiated by the presence or lack of duty cycling, indicate that our RPL implementation outperforms the one provided in Contiki in terms of average packet delivery rates by up to 200% in networks with 100 nodes.},

GridSpice seamlessly integrates existing electric power simulation tools to enable modeling of large electric networks that blur the boundaries between generation, transmission, distribution, and markets. This is achieved via a cloud-based architecture that allows for parallelizing large simulation jobs across many virtual machines using a pay-as-you-go model. GridSpice simulations can be managed through a Representational State Transfer (REST) application programming interface (API), or through a Python library, allowing users to run simulations programmatically and interface with disparate data inputs, energy management systems (EMS), distribution management systems (DMS), and postprocessing tools. These capabilities make GridSpice an ideal tool for the development and testing of new grid control and optimization algorithms. GridSpice also provides an easy-to-use browser-based interface to allow novice users to begin without any setup or configuration on their local PC. A first implementation of the GridSpice framework integrates Gridlab-D and MATPOWER as simulation tools, and has been used for projects including optimizing the placement of distributed generation and developing optimal dispatch schedules for flexible loads. The GridSpice framework and Gridlab-D are freely available in open-source under the BSD license.},

The IEEE 802.15.4 has shown good characteristics for deterministic networks in beacon-enabled mode, but with minimum cyclic update time for personal area network devices not less than 15.36 ms. Moreover, it is unsuitable for hard real-time systems when used in nonbeacon-enabled mode due to the random nature of channel access protocol. The proposed technique employs time-division multiple access (TDMA)-based protocol that works on slightly modified IEEE 802.15.4 in star topology. Each end device in the network transmits its data frame after certain time delay in response to periodic requests from the coordinator. This time delay is optimized for better channel bandwidth utilization and reliable data exchange. While this TDMA-based protocol eliminates the risk of frame collisions to a great extent, medium-access control sublayer modifications reduce the nondeterminism of the network and increase the bandwidth efficiency. A mathematical model is proposed to design and develop a practical communication network with commercial off-the-shelf radios that can predict worst case arrival time of data frames. Experiments were conducted to evaluate the model for the proposed protocol.},

Event-based predictive and hybrid sensor and actuator communication schemes are compared with respect to their capabilities and implementation complexity. A two double-tank laboratory experimental setup, mimicking some typical industrial process control loops, is used to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach.

  Abstract                 = {For mitigation of power quality problems in a distribution system, it is important to estimate effecting factors which are responsible for their origin. Main objectives of neural network application in Distribution Static Compensator (DSTATCOM) are to enhance the efficiency, robustness, tracking capability according to requirements. A control algorithm based on load conductance estimation using the neural network is implemented for DSTATCOM in a four wire distribution system. The proposed control algorithm is used for extraction of load fundamental conductance and susceptance components of distorted load currents. It is implementated for mitigation of power quality problems such as reactive power compensation, harmonics elimination, load balancing and reduction of neutral current under linear/nonlinear loads. Test results on a developed DSTATCOM have shown the acceptable level of performance under balanced and unbalanced loads.},

  Abstract                 = {Mechatronic systems operating in industrial environments are subject to a variety of threats because of harsh conditions. Industrial systems usually use commercial off-the shelf (COTS) equipment which are not robust and safe against hostile conditions and therefore require fault-tolerance considerations. This paper presents a novel and efficient method for online detection of control flow errors, called software-based control flow checking (SCFC). It is implemented purely in software and does not manipulate the hardware architecture of the system. Redundant instructions and signatures are embedded into the program at compile time and are utilized for control flow checking at run time. The signatures of the basic blocks are derived from the program graph. It is shown in the paper that SCFC method can increase single detection capability to 14.7% and the fault coverage to 6.12% averagely in comparison with other methods without any increase in memory and performance overheads. In the paper, besides experimental evaluations, analytical evaluations are also carried out, based on probability principles. The detection ability of each method used is thus computed. These computations verify the experimental results and show that SCFC can detect more errors than other methods suggested in literature. Considering the memory limitations in some (such as space) applications and the trend towards the requirement for faster execution of programs, we suggest a novel metric called fitness parameter which incorporates these. It is a better measure than the previously proposed ones since it considers the fault coverage, the memory overhead and the execution time (performance overhead) of each method simultaneously, as well as the detection capability.},

On the other hand, in a network of interacting components with different data acquisition frequencies, there are many time series related to each other that cannot be disaggregated using the existing TSD methods. This work initially formulates a TSD method for a single time series with variable time step and then extends it to many related time series with variable time steps. Comparative studies show superiority of the proposed TSD methods over the existing approaches. The method is verified by numerical examples and then applied to a gas network with 284 related time series.},

In order to enhance the discriminative power of the model, a number of clustered background subspaces are also added into the basis library and updated during tracking.

  Abstract                 = {For computer vision-based inspection of electronic chips or dies in semiconductor production lines, we propose a new method to effectively and efficiently detect defects in images. Different from the traditional methods that compare the image of each test chip or die with the template image one by one, which are sensitive to misalignment between the test and template images, a collection of multiple test images are used as the input image for processing simultaneously in our method with two steps. The first step is to obtain salient regions of the whole collection of test images, and the second step is to evaluate local discrepancy between salient regions in test images and the corresponding regions in the defect-free template image. To be more specific, in the first step of our method, phase-only Fourier transform (POFT), which is computationally efficient for online applications in industry, is used for saliency detection. We provide the theoretical justification for POFT to be effective to attenuate the normal regions and amplify the defects in multiple test images, which are usually arranged in a matrix format in industrial practice. By comparing with four other popular methods, the proposed algorithm can efficiently accommodate small variations (inevitable in practice) in test chips or dies, such as the spatial misalignments and product variations. Experimental results on a large-scale database including 1073 images, 94 of which are defective, show that our method performs much better than the other methods in terms of precision, recall, and F-measure.},

However, in this paper, we show that Fan et al.'s scheme has a serious security flaw and cannot meet data integrity requirement at all. Specifically, by observing the user registration procedure in Fan et al.'s scheme, we find that each user's private key can be easily derived from the information published by the aggregator. Then, with the derived private key, an attacker can inject polluted data to user's real data without being detected. As a result, data integrity will be completely violated. We hope that with our comment, similar mistakes can be avoided in future design of privacy-preserving data aggregation with data integrity protection.},

This trend includes among others the use of high-level languages, such as Java, and Internet protocols (HTTP and Web Services). Although many industrial systems use these technologies at their business layers, they are far from offering a homogeneous programming platform in their most internal infrastructures. This paper extends the current practice by introducing a real-time Java-centric architecture for industrial systems. The architecture integrates existing and upcoming technology to define a Java-based approach. The empirical evidence, included in the paper, illustrates the performance of the core of the industrial layer of this architecture.},

However, traditional machine learning methods assume that the training data and the test data are drawn from the same distribution, which is hard to be met in real world banking applications. This paper proposes a novel algorithm known as fuzzy refinement domain adaptation to solve this problem based on the ecosystem-oriented architecture. The algorithm utilizes the fuzzy system and similarity/dissimilarity concepts to modify the target instances' labels which were initially predicted by a shift-unaware prediction model. It employs a classifier to modify the label values of target instances based on their similarity/dissimilarity to the candidate positive and negative instances in mixture domains. Thirty six experiments are performed using three different shift-unaware prediction models. In these experiments bank failure financial data is used to evaluate the algorithm. The results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm significantly improves predictive accuracy and outperforms other refinement algorithms.},

Among RTE protocols, the EtherCAT standard is suitable for motion control and closed-loop control applications, which require very short cycle times. As EtherCAT was specifically devised for periodic traffic, aperiodic real-time transmissions are far from being efficient, as they entail long cycle times. To overcome this limitation, this paper presents a general framework for priority-driven swapping (PdS)-based scheduling of aperiodic real-time messages over EtherCAT networks, which uniformly covers both dynamic and static priority and allows for very short cycle times. This paper provides a description of the PdS framework, a schedulability analysis for both static priority and dynamic priority scheduling, and simulative assessments obtained through OMNeT++ simulations.},

The first layer deals with the voltage and frequency control of VCVSIs. The second layer regulates the active and reactive powers of CCVSIs. These controllers are implemented through two communication networks with one-way communication links and are fully distributed; each DG only requires its own information and the information of its neighbors on the communication network graph.

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a distributed algorithm based on auction techniques and consensus protocols to solve the nonconvex economic dispatch problem. The optimization problem of the nonconvex economic dispatch includes several constraints such as valve-point loading effect, multiple fuel option, and prohibited operating zones. Each generating unit locally evaluates quantities used as bids in the auction mechanism. These units send their bids to their neighbors in a communication graph that supports the power system and which provides the required information flow. A consensus procedure is used to share the bids among the network agents and resolves the auction. As a result, the power distribution of generating units is updated and the generation cost is minimized. The effectiveness of this approach is demonstrated by simulations on standard test systems.},

Toward this end, we devise a novel statistical cosimulation (electricity grid, communication, and control) framework that faithfully mimics the characteristics of real-world microgrids in terms of communication and grid topologies, power demand, and distributed generation from solar sources. Our numerical results highlight the role of communication procedures and the differences among the selected optimization techniques for power loss reduction, assessing their convergence rate and quantifying the impact of communication failures, line impedance estimation error, communication and electricity grid topologies, network size, and number of DGs.},

The simulation environment utilizes the so-called layered lighting design, which allows one to evaluate the performance of different control strategies. Furthermore, the environment can be used to validate the performance of a lighting control strategy, in quasi-real-time, and assess its potential energy savings. The above approach has not been investigated in prior literature and may thus be of interest in energy-aware automated lighting systems.

In this paper, the distribution of total (end-to-end) delay associated with fault diagnosis and reconfiguration of shipboard power system (SPS) is investigated from a cyber-physical systems (CPS) perspective. Specifically, a cross-layer end-to-end delay analysis framework is introduced for SPS reconfiguration. The proposed framework stochastically models the heterogeneity of actions of various subsystems involved in the reconfiguration tasks viz., generation of fault information by sensor nodes associated to the power system, processing of actions at control center to resolve fault locations and reconfiguration, and flow of information through communication network to perform necessary actions. The proposed framework then combines appropriately the output delay distributions from each subsystem to: 1) analytically predict the distribution of end-to-end delay in SPS reconfiguration after the occurrence of faults and 2) analyze and design real-time reconfiguration solutions for shipboard CPS, that meet total delay requirements. Simulations using various topological scenarios demonstrate that the proposed analytical framework closely predict the total delay associated with SPS reconfiguration.},

  Abstract                 = {The adoption of networked multiagent systems (MAS) has been recently proposed for the solution of the volt/var control (VVC) problem in distribution feeders. However, constraints and limitations due to the communication network, to the dynamic behavior of power system components and regulators, as well as to the measurement uncertainties of the adopted sensors need to be specifically analyzed for the design of the MAS. For this purpose, a cosimulation platform has been built by the integration of two simulation tools: 1) the electromagnetic transient program EMTP-rv; and 2) the communication network simulator Riverbed-OPNET Modeler. This paper presents the modeling and simulation of an asynchronous leaderless MAS-based approach that coordinates the reactive power outputs of a set of power compensators equipped with phasor measurement units via a shared band-limited packet-switched digital communication network. The effects of communication network latency and packet loss on the VVC performances are analyzed for two unbalanced IEEE Test feeders equipped with on-load tap changer transformers. The paper compares the results obtained by using a transmission control protocol (TCP) and a user datagram protocol (UDP), for different levels of background traffic (BT) and different packet discard ratios (PDRs) in the communication links.},

  Abstract                 = {A multistage advanced statistical method has been proposed for the real-time wind-electric power generation forecast of wind power plants (WPPs) based on a combination of artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM) models. In the first stage, output data of wind speed and wind direction from different numerical weather prediction (NWP) models are chosen among a set of grid points in the neighborhood of each WPP to train the ANN and SVM models. The best grids are then selected from those NWP grid data giving the minimum training error, and used for training and testing the developed wind-electric power forecast models. In the second stage, for each NWP data, ANN and SVM models are applied separately. The forecast errors are corrected by applying model output statistics (MOS) at the third stage. Different 48-h ahead forecasts of wind-electric power are then combined at the fourth stage by appropriate weighting factors to obtain an intermediate 48-h ahead forecast of the electrical power generated from wind. In the final stage, these forecast data are recombined to give an ultimate forecast. The proposed model is tested on 25 WPPs satisfactorily. The performance of the proposed multistage cascaded statistical model is compared with the available benchmark models and actual wind-electric power generation data. It has been shown that the proposed model performs better than the reference models in terms of short-term forecast accuracy, especially for WPPs in complex terrains with a scattered wind regime.},

  Abstract                 = {Internet of Things (IoT) software is required not only to dispose of huge volumes of real-time and heterogeneous data, but also to support different complex applications for business purposes. Using an ontology approach, a Configurable Information Service Platform is proposed for the development of IoT-based application. Based on an abstract information model, information encapsulating, composing, discomposing, transferring, tracing, and interacting in Product Lifecycle Management could be carried out. Combining ontology and representational state transfer (REST)-ful service, the platform provides an information support base both for data integration and intelligent interaction. A case study is given to verify the platform. It is shown that the platform provides a promising way to realize IoT application in semantic level.},

  Abstract                 = {Compressive sensing (CS) is a new approach to simultaneous sensing and compressing that is highly promising for fully distributed compression in wireless sensor networks (WSNs). While a wide investigation has been performed about theory and practice of CS for individual signals, real and practical cases, in general, involve multiple signals, extending the problem of compression from 1-D single-sensor to 2-D multiple-sensors data. In this paper the two most prominent frameworks on sparsity and compressibility of multidimensional signals and signal ensembles, Distributed compressed sensing (DCS) and Kronecker compressive sensing (KCS), are investigated. In this paper we compare these two frameworks against a common set of artificial signals properly built to embody the main characteristics of natural signals. We further investigate how, in a real deployment, DCS can be used to reduce the power consumption and to prolong lifetime. In particular an extensive analysis is performed using real commercial off-the-shelf (COTS) hardware evaluating how different kind of compression matrices can affect the jointly reconstruction, trying to achieve the better tradeoff between quality and energy expenditure.},

A set of admittance-based Z-transform functions that reflect the current physical components suggested by the CPC is constructed. The resulting transfer functions are shown to reflect the electric physical significance, and are used for electric load and machine identification through its electric characteristics. In this paper, the Z-transform analytic expressions are developed and extended along with their physical comprehension. Moreover, the strength of the theory over more traditional spectral analysis is explained. The method presented in this paper is demonstrated and analyzed using real-world measured waveforms (measured by power quality monitors).},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose a global power management approach for energy harvesting sensor nodes. Our approach is based on a joint duty-cycle optimization and transmission power control. By simultaneously adapting both parameters, the node can maximize the number of transmitted packets while respecting the limited and time-varying amount of available energy. We obtain a high-packet delivery by using an original predictive transmission power control that can efficiently adapt the transmission power to the wireless channel conditions. To accurately model the wireless channel and the node communication hardware, a waveform-level radio frequency simulator has been developed. Simulation results show 6.5 times improvement in energy efficiency and a packet reception ratio which is 9 times more efficient than a recently published technique. A 15% increase in energy efficiency, with respect to a fixed transmission power configuration, has also been observed. Finally, the global power management strategy has been validated on a real wireless sensor networks platform. Experimental results are very similar to those obtained in simulations, and thus confirm the efficiency of our power management approach.},

We propose such a configuration, reconfiguration, and processing mechanism in the form of a software architecture. A node component should be deployed in any embedded device and implements application programming interface (API), configuration, processing, and communication. The resulting system provides remote configuration and processing of data in any node in a most flexible way, since every node has the same uniform API, processing, and access functionalities.

In this paper, a mechanism is presented that prevents the occurrence of stuff bits in the whole frame completely. It makes the duration of frame transmissions fixed and, hence, it achieves very accurate reception times. An optimized codec has been implemented to demonstrate that this approach is feasible and can be profitably adopted in low-cost networked embedded systems with demanding timing constraints.},

  Abstract                 = {Today's decreasing product development cycle time requires rapid and cost-effective reliability analysis and testing. Qualification is the process of demonstrating that a product is capable of meeting or exceeding specified requirements. Light-emitting diode (LED) qualification tests are often as long as 6000 h, but this length of time does not guarantee the typically required lifetime of 10 years or more. This paper presents a prognostics-based technique that reduces the LED qualification time. An anomaly detection technique called the similarity-based metric test is developed to identify anomalies without utilizing historical libraries of healthy and unhealthy data. The similarity-based metric test extracts features from the spectral power distributions (SPDs) using peak analysis, reduces the dimensionality of the features using principal component analysis, and partitions the data set of principal components into groups using a k-nearest neighbor (KNN)-kernel density-based clustering technique. A detection algorithm then evaluates the distances from the centroid of each cluster to each test point and detects anomalies when the distance is greater than the threshold. From this, the dominant degradation processes associated with the LED die and phosphors in the LED package can be identified. In our case study, anomalies were detected at less than 1200 h using the similarity-based metric test. Thus, our method could decrease the amount of LED qualification testing time by providing users with an earlier time to begin remaining useful life prediction without waiting 6000 h as required by industrial standards.},

  Abstract                 = {Access control is a necessary building block in the security of any kind of cyber system and, in this sense, industrial networked systems (INSs) make no exception. Typically, access control policies are specified at a high implementation-independent level of abstraction and then mapped onto the real system by leveraging available policy enforcement mechanisms. Unfortunately, different from general-purpose ICT systems, enforcement mechanisms are generally very basic in INS. As a consequence, verifying the correctness of policy implementation becomes a crucial task, especially cumbersome when it needs to be carried out entirely by hand. This paper presents a new methodology, which also serves as the basis of a purposely developed software tool conceived to cope with the lack of policy enforcement mechanisms in INS and to allow semiautomatic verification of policy implementation. Our approach is based on a twofold system model that enables both the abstract specification of access control policies and the detailed description of the target physical system. These two separate views are then combined to automatically determine whether the current system implementation matches the policy specification.},

  Abstract                 = {Plug-in hybrid electric vehicles' (PHEVs) integration can result in additional electricity consumers and electricity suppliers in microgrids (MGs). This paper presents a new method for optimal integration of PHEVs in MGs, which considers the optimal number of parking numbers under optimal scheduling of PHEVs. Due to the uncertainty of solar energy, the radial basis function network (RBFN) techniques are used for forecasting photovoltaic (PV) power output. Monte Carlo simulation is used to deal with the uncertainties associated with the daily distance driven of the PHEVs, load values, and electricity market price. The objective is the minimization of total cost (TC) and optimal set of the optimization problem is found using genetic algorithm (GA) method. In order to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method, two market policies are used as case studies. The computation results can be used to evaluate the impact of PHEVs' integration on economical performance of MGs.},

  Abstract                 = {A niche genetic algorithm (GA) based on a novel twin-space crowding (TC) approach is proposed for solving multimodal manufacturing optimization problems. The proposed TC method is designed in a parameter-free paradigm. That is, when cooperatively exploring solutions with GAs, it does not require prior knowledge related to the solution space to design additional problem-dependent parameters in the evolutionary process. This feature makes the proposed TC method suitable for assisting GAs in solving real-world engineering optimization problems involving intractable solution landscapes. A set of numerical benchmark functions is used to compare effectiveness and efficiency in the proposed TCGA, in different niche GAs, and in several evolutionary computation methods. The TCGA is then used to solve multimodal joint-space inverse problems in serial-link robots to compare its convergence performance with that of conventional methods that apply the sharing function. Finally, the TCGA is used to solve iterative collision-free design problems for linkage-bar robotic hands to demonstrate its effectiveness for generating diverse solutions during the design process.},

Recognition of the temperature condition is an important component of a temperature control system. Because of the interference of smoke and dust in the kiln, the temperature of the burning zone is difficult to be measured accurately using traditional methods. Focusing on blurry images from which only the flame region can be segmented, an image recognition system for the detection of the temperature condition in a rotary kiln is presented. First, the flame region is segmented employing a region-growing method with a dynamic seed point. Seven features, comprising three luminous features and four dynamic features, are then extracted from the flame region. Dynamic features constructed from luminous feature sequences are proposed to overcome the problem of mis-recognition when the temperature of the flame region changes rapidly. Finally, classifiers are trained to recognize the temperature state of the burning zone using its features. Experimental results using real datasets demonstrate that the proposed image-based systems for recognizing the temperature condition are effective and robust.},

  Abstract                 = {How to improve social communication skills for children, especially those with social communication difficulties such as attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder, has long been a challenge faced by researchers and therapists. Recent research indicates that computer-assisted approaches may be effective in addressing this issue. This study aimed to understand children's behaviors and then provide appropriate support to improve their social communication skills. We have established an intelligent system, inside which a child can freely play interactive social skills games with virtual characters. The virtual characters can adjust their own behaviors by adapting to the child's cognitive state (e.g., focus of attention) and affective state (e.g., happiness or surprise). The child's behavior is identified in real-time by recognition of multimodal sensory information, which includes head pose and eye gaze estimation, gesture detection, and affective state detection supported by a series of algorithms proposed in this study. Furthermore, this intelligent system has been enabled in a nonintrusive manner using a novel approach of multicamera surveillance to provide the child with natural interaction with the system. Experimental results show the system can estimate a user's attention and affective states with correctness rates of 93% and 91.3%, respectively. The results obtained suggest that the methods have strong potential as alternative methods for sensing human behavior and providing appropriate support.},

Minimization of energy consumption for a certain trip with terrain preview based on the operating efficiencies of in-wheel motors and a traffic model is essential to maximize the total travel distances of an EGV. Unlike conducting energy optimization under given vehicle speed profiles that are specified a priori in most literature, the optimally varied vehicle velocity and globally optimal in-wheel motor actuation torque distributions are simultaneously obtained to minimize the EGV energy consumption by employing the dynamic programming method for the first time. As a comparison, CarSim-matlab/Simulink co-simulation results based on a model predictive control design are displayed to not only validate that the energy optimization results from the EMDS design is a benchmark with the least power consumption, but also to show that the driving strategy derived from the EMDS can be potentially utilized as an energy-optimal speed reference for other real-time implementable methods.},

The saliency signals of a typical cwSPMSM under consideration are experimentally investigated. The stator background and physical mechanism of its strong multiple saliencies are explained in detail. Instead of processing the primary saliency signal, secondary saliency signal that has a better signal to noise ratio and more precise resolution is processed by a specially designed bandpass filter, and an adaptive notch filter for speed and rotor position estimation.

  Abstract                 = {Industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) have to contend with environments that are usually harsh and time-varying. Industrial wireless technology, such as WirelessHART and ISA 100.11a, also operates in a frequency spectrum utilized by many other wireless technologies. With wireless applications rapidly growing, it is possible that multiple heterogeneous wireless systems would need to operate in overlapping spatiotemporal regions. Interference such as noise or other wireless devices affects connectivity and reduces communication link quality. This negatively affects reliability and latency, which are core requirements of industrial communication. Building wireless networks that are resistant to noise in industrial environments and coexisting with competing wireless devices in an increasingly crowded frequency spectrum is challenging. To meet these challenges, we need to consider the benefits that approaches finding success in other application areas can offer industrial communication. Cognitive radio (CR) methods offer a potential solution to improve resistance of IWSNs to interference. Integrating CR principles into the lower layers of IWSNs can enable devices to detect and avoid interference, and potentially opens the possibility of utilizing free radio spectrum for additional communication channels. This improves resistance to noise and increases redundancy in terms of channels per network node or adding additional nodes. In this paper, we summarize CR methods relevant to industrial applications, covering CR architecture, spectrum access and interference management, spectrum sensing, dynamic spectrum access (DSA), game theory, and CR network (CRN) security.},

  Abstract                 = {In networked control systems, the Try-Once-Discard (TOD) protocol is of high interest because its properties can be characterized by Lyapunov functions. This feature makes it practical to incorporate TOD into Lyapunov-based design of linear and nonlinear control systems, yielding a self-contained theory for system stabilization. In previous work, candidates for TOD realizations for single-hop (wired and wireless) networks have been proposed. However, it has been a hitherto open question whether TOD can be realized in wireless multihop networks. In fact, it is far from obvious how dynamic value-based competition with deterministically bounded maximum delay, as required by TOD, is achievable in wireless multihop networks. In this paper, we give a positive answer to this question, by presenting a functionally complete realization of TOD in wireless multihop networks. Our solution is based on highly accurate multihop tick synchronization, and applies an algorithm for collision-protected network-wide value arbitration with deterministic delay. We provide experimental evidence for the feasibility of our solution on existing micro controller platforms, and assess our TOD realization in a batch reactor scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {Field programmable gate array (FPGA) devices are increasingly being deployed in industrial environments, making reconfigurable hardware testing and reliability an active area of investigation. While FPGA devices can be tested exhaustively, the so-called application-dependent test (ADT) has emerged as an effective approach ensuring reduced testing efforts and improving the manufacturing yield since it can selectively exclude a subset of faults not affecting a given design. In addition to manufacturing, ADT can be used online, providing a solution for fast runtime fault detection and diagnostics. This paper identifies a number of issues in existing ADT techniques which limit their applicability and proposes new approaches improving the range of covered faults, with special emphasis on feedback bridging faults, as well as new algorithms for generating ADT test configurations. Furthermore, the work introduces a software environment addressing the current lack of tools, either academic or commercial, supporting ADT techniques. The architecture of the environment is highly modular and extensively based on a plug-in approach. To demonstrate the potential of the toolset, we developed a complete suite of plug-ins, based on both state-of-the-art ADT techniques and the novel approaches introduced here. The experimental results presented at the end of the paper confirm the impact of the proposed techniques.},

In this paper, a formal model is proposed for the application of SOAs in the distributed automation domain in order to achieve flexible automation systems. Practical scenarios of applying SOA in industrial automation are discussed. In order to support the SOA IEC 61499 model, a service-based execution environment architecture is proposed.

  Abstract                 = {As the next generation power grid, smart grid is characterized as an informationized system, and demand response is one of its important features to deal with the ever-increasing peak energy usage. However, the supply capacity and required demand make the demand response problem with both spatially and temporally coupled constraints, which, to the best of our knowledge, has not been thoroughly investigated in a distributed manner. The complexity lies in how to guarantee privacy and convergence of distributed algorithms. Aiming at this challenge, in this paper, we first propose a distributed algorithm, which is based on dual decomposition and does not require each user to reveal his/her private information. Then, the convergence analysis is conducted to provide guidance on how to choose the proper step size; through which, we notice that the convergence speed of the subgradient projection method is not fast enough and it is highly dependent on the choice of the step size. Therefore, to increase the convergence rate of the distributed algorithm, we further propose a fast approach based on binary search. Finally, the distributed algorithms are illustrated by numerical simulations and the extensive comparison results validate the better performance of the fast approach.},

Specifically, we first introduce the means/tariffs that the power utility takes to incentivize users to reschedule their energy usage patterns. Then we survey the existing mathematical models and problems in the previous and current literatures, followed by the state-of-the-art approaches and solutions to address these issues.

The proposed control principle, in essence, is to continuously adjust the filter inductance of the active reactor by regulating active power filter (APF) output current in terms of its magnitude and direction. Therefore, the ATHPF using the bidirectional control principle can simultaneously supply different impedances at different selective suppressed harmonic frequencies. The bidirectional control principle can perform both the normal active tuning function and the abnormal active detuning function. To be specific, the normal active tuning function refers to the harmonic elimination with filtering performance independent of the deviation of passive filter parameters, while the latter, the abnormal active detuning function, refers to the flexible protection against harmonic over-current without losing two harmonic elimination and reactive power compensation at the occurrence of harmonic over-current. Experimental results verify the effectiveness of the ATHPF with the bidirectional control principle in selective harmonic elimination and flexible protection against harmonic over-current.},

A simple notch-filtering control algorithm is designed to facilitate extraction of the real component of load current, exempting the services of a phase locked loop (PLL). The absence of a PLL reduces the system dependence on the proportional-integral (PI) controller tuning, which in turn improves the dynamic response and makes the system quite robust. The proposed solar PV generation system retains its ability of mitigating harmonics on cloudy days and also provides opportunity for night time utilization of available resources. The system has been analyzed under both linear and nonlinear varying loads using and an experimental verification of the results is carried out on a developed prototype of the system.},

  Abstract                 = {Fast and effective monitoring following airborne releases of toxic substances is critical to mitigate risks to threatened population areas. Electrically powered systems in industrial settings require monitoring of emitted electromagnetic fields to determine the status of the equipment and ensure their safe operation. In situations such as these, wireless sensor nodes (WSNs) at fixed predetermined locations provide monitoring to ensure safety. A challenging algorithmic problem is determining the locations to place these WSNs while meeting several criteria: (1) to provide complete coverage of the domain; (2) to create a topology with problem-dependent node densities; and (3) to minimize the number of WSNs. This paper presents a novel approach, advancing front mesh generation with constrained Delaunay triangulation and smoothing (AFECETS) that addresses these criteria. A unique aspect of AFECETS is the ability to determine WSN locations for areas of high interest (hospitals, schools, and high population density areas) that require higher density of nodes for monitoring environmental conditions, a feature that is difficult to find in other research work. The AFECETS algorithm was tested on several arbitrary shaped domains. AFECETS simulation results show that the algorithm provides significant reduction in the number of nodes, in some cases over 40%, compared with an advancing front mesh generation algorithm; maintains and improves optimal spacing between nodes; and produces simulation run times suitable for real-time applications.},

The scheme divides the processing tasks in industrial facilities into nonschedulable tasks (NSTs) and schedulable tasks (STs), and takes advantage of distributed energy resources (DERs) to implement DR. Based on day-ahead hourly electricity prices, the scheme determines the scheduling of STs and DERs in order to shift the demand from peak periods (with high electricity prices) to off-peak periods (with low electricity prices), which not only improves the reliability of the electric power system, but also reduces energy costs for industrial facilities.},

However, service users may encounter three major issues - heterogeneity, ubiquity, and ambiguity, when searching for mining service information over the Internet. In this paper, we present the framework of a novel self-adaptive semantic focused crawler - SASF crawler, with the purpose of precisely and efficiently discovering, formatting, and indexing mining service information over the Internet, by taking into account the three major issues. This framework incorporates the technologies of semantic focused crawling and ontology learning, in order to maintain the performance of this crawler, regardless of the variety in the Web environment.

  Abstract                 = {Time synchronization is crucial for cyber-physical systems (CPSs), e.g., wireless sensor and actuator networks. Cyber physical security is an important yet challenging problem. In particular, attacks to the time synchronization service may incur data distortion or even malfunction of the whole system. Sybil attack is one of the most common attack types for sensor networks, where a node illegitimately claims multiple identities. Existing secure time-synchronization protocols; however, cannot well address Sybil attacks in the time synchronization process. We propose a robust and secure time-synchronization protocol (RTSP) to defend against Sybil attacks. Different from previous secure timesync protocols, RTSP employs a novel graph theoretical approach, which is able to perform anomaly detection at the message level instead of the node level. This fine-grained detection ability enables RTSP to become robust against Sybil attacks, as well as node compromise and message manipulation attacks. Extensive experimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed protocol.},

In this system, both the network-induced delay and data packed dropout phenomena are considered.

  Abstract                 = {Recent studies have highlighted that a significant part of the electrical energy consumption in residential buildings is caused by an improper use of home appliances. The development of low-cost systems for profiling the consumption of electric appliances can play a key role in stimulating the users to adopt adequate policies for energy saving. In this paper, we describe a novel methodology for extracting the power consumption of each appliance deployed in a domestic environment from the aggregate measures collected by a single smart meter. In order to coarsely describe how each type of appliance works, we use finite-state machines (FSMs) based on fuzzy transitions. An ad-hoc disaggregation algorithm exploits a database of these FSMs for, at each meaningful variation in real and reactive aggregate powers, hypothesizing possible configurations of active appliances. This set of configurations is concurrently managed by the algorithm which, whenever requested, outputs the configuration with the highest confidence with respect to the sequence of detected events. We implemented a prototype of a monitoring system based on the proposed methodology and installed it in a real domestic scenario. We discuss an experiment in which 11 appliances were connected to the same circuit and the aggregate power consumption was measured by a smart meter for approximately 12 h. At the end of the experiment, only two possible configurations were outputs from the system, including the correct one.},

  Abstract                 = {Electrification of performance vehicles brings several challenges, such as the necessity of high-power sources, which can satisfy the power requirements during acceleration and efficiently retrieve energy during deceleration without performance and life cycle deterioration of such sources. In addition, the limited space under the hood for these vehicles eliminates the possibility of utilizing large volume high-power propulsion machines. This paper proposes a fuzzy logic supervisory wavelet-transform frequency decoupling-based energy management strategy implemented on a new powertrain deploying two propulsion machines rated at different powers with a hybrid battery/ultracapacitor (UC) energy storage system (ESS). The proposed control and energy management strategy guarantees that battery and UC provide the base and transient-free powers, respectively, while state of charge (SOC) of UC is maintained at an optimal value. The torque demand is split among the propulsion machines by solving the formulated unconstrained optimization problem. With the proposed hybrid ESS and energy/power decoupling strategy, power density of the ESS can be increased, vehicle performance can be improved, and battery lifetime can be prolonged.},

  Abstract                 = {In information systems, applications are required to be realized in the digital ecosystems, high performance systems, and scalable systems. In these applications, a client first selects a server in a cluster of servers and issues a request to the server. The request is performed as a process in the server. In this paper, we consider a computation process which mainly consumes the central processing unit (CPU) resources. Cooling devices, such as fans, consume the electric power in addition to the CPU of a server. The rotation speed of a fan is revved up in servers in order to decrease the temperature of a server. Thus, the total power consumption of a server depends on not only computational devices such as a CPU, but also cooling devices. We discuss an extended simple power consumption (ESPC) model of a server with a multicore CPU and cooling devices to perform computation type processes. It is critical to discuss how to select a server for each request issued by a client in order to not only achieve performance objectives, but also reduce the total power consumption of a system based on the ESPC model. An improved power consumption laxity-based (IPCLB) algorithm for selecting a server is proposed in this paper, where the minimum power to be consumed is used to perform the process. We evaluate the ESPC model and IPCLB algorithm in terms of power consumption and elapse time.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a competent method for broken bars fault identification in line-start and inverter-fed industrial induction motors. The basis of the proposed method is to determine different frequency bands of the faulty motor current and extract a proper intrinsic mode function (IMF) developed by empirical mode decomposition (EMD). It is analytically proved that two specific IMFs, IMF2 in line-start mode and IMF3 in inverter-fed mode, can be used for precise prediction of the behavior of a faulty induction motor. The precision of the method is shown at different operating points, including different loads, fault, and reference speeds. The results indicate that the motor asymmetry is remarkably reduced at distributed broken bars. In addition, the proposed method is capable of determining the operating point of the faulty motor even at no/light loads. Finally, the Filippetti criterion is used, and a new aspect is analytically developed to justify the variations of IMF3 with speed in an inverter-fed induction motor. The analytical results are verified by experiments.},

  Abstract                 = {According to related research, energy consumption can be effectively reduced by using energy management information of smart grids. In smart grid architecture, electricity suppliers can monitor, predicate, and control energy generation/consumption in real time. Users can know the current price of electrical energy and obtain energy management information from smart meters. It helps users reduce home's energy use. However, electricity consumptions of users may divulge the privacy information of users. Therefore, privacy of users and communication security of the smart grid become crucial security issues. This paper presents a secure power-usage data aggregation scheme for smart grid. Electricity suppliers can learn about the current power usage of each neighborhood to arrange energy supply and distribution without knowing the individual electricity consumption of each user. This is the first scheme against internal attackers, and it provides secure batch verification. Additionally, the security of the proposed scheme is demonstrated by formal proofs.},

Ontology aids computers in further understanding the symptoms and medical resources, which helps to create a rehabilitation strategy and reconfigure medical resources according to patients' specific requirements quickly and automatically. Meanwhile, IoT provides an effective platform to interconnect all the resources and provides immediate information interaction.

Effective and scientific management of water resources requires a good understanding of water cycles, and a systematic integration of observations can lead to better prediction results. This paper presents an integrated approach to water resource management based on geoinformatics including technologies such as Remote Sensing (RS), Geographical Information Systems (GIS), Global Positioning Systems (GPS), Enterprise Information Systems (EIS), and cloud services. The paper introduces a prototype IIS called Water Resource Management Enterprise Information System (WRMEIS) that integrates functions such as data acquisition, data management and sharing, modeling, and knowledge management. A system called SFFEIS (Snowmelt Flood Forecasting Enterprise Information System) based on the WRMEIS structure has been implemented. It includes operational database, Extraction-Transformation-Loading (ETL), information warehouse, temporal and spatial analysis, simulation/prediction models, knowledge management, and other functions. In this study, a prototype water resource management IIS is developed which integrates geoinformatics, EIS, and cloud service. It also proposes a novel approach to information management that allows any participant play the role as a sensor as well as a contributor to the information warehouse. Both users and public play the role for providing data and knowledge.

  Abstract                 = {Climate change and environmental monitoring and management have received much attention recently, and an integrated information system (IIS) is considered highly valuable. This paper introduces a novel IIS that combines Internet of Things (IoT), Cloud Computing, Geoinformatics [remote sensing (RS), geographical information system (GIS), and global positioning system (GPS)], and e-Science for environmental monitoring and management, with a case study on regional climate change and its ecological effects. Multi-sensors and Web services were used to collect data and other information for the perception layer; both public networks and private networks were used to access and transport mass data and other information in the network layer. The key technologies and tools include real-time operational database (RODB); extraction-transformation-loading (ETL); on-line analytical processing (OLAP) and relational OLAP (ROLAP); naming, addressing, and profile server (NAPS); application gateway (AG); application software for different platforms and tasks (APPs); IoT application infrastructure (IoT-AI); GIS and e-Science platforms; and representational state transfer/Java database connectivity (RESTful/JDBC). Application Program Interfaces (APIs) were implemented in the middleware layer of the IIS. The application layer provides the functions of storing, organizing, processing, and sharing of data and other information, as well as the functions of applications in environmental monitoring and management. The results from the case study show that there is a visible increasing trend of the air temperature in Xinjiang over the last 50 years (1962-2011) and an apparent increasing trend of the precipitation since the early 1980s. Furthermore, from the correlation between ecological indicators [gross primary production (GPP), net primary production (NPP), and leaf area index (LAI)] and meteorological elements (air temperature and precipitation), water resource availability is the decisi- e factor with regard to the terrestrial ecosystem in the area. The study shows that the research work is greatly benefited from such an IIS, not only in data collection supported by IoT, but also in Web services and applications based on cloud computing and e-Science platforms, and the effectiveness of monitoring processes and decision-making can be obviously improved. This paper provides a prototype IIS for environmental monitoring and management, and it also provides a new paradigm for the future research and practice; especially in the era of big data and IoT.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, the fields of reconfigurable manufacturing systems, holonic manufacturing systems, and multiagent systems have made technological advances to support the ready reconfiguration of automated manufacturing systems. While these technological advances have demonstrated robust operation and been qualitatively successful in achieving reconfigurability, their ultimate industrial adoption remains limited. Among the barriers to adoption has been the relative absence of formal and quantitative multiagent system design methodologies based on reconfigurability measurement. Hence, it is not clear that the degree to which these designs have achieved their intended level of reconfigurability, which systems are indeed quantitatively more reconfigurable, and how these designs may overcome their design limitations to achieve greater reconfigurability in subsequent design iterations. To our knowledge, this paper is the first multiagent system reference architecture for reconfigurable manufacturing systems driven by a quantitative and formal design approach. It is rooted in an established engineering design methodology called axiomatic design for large flexible engineering systems and draws upon design principles distilled from prior works on reconfigurability measurement. The resulting architecture is written in terms of the mathematical description used in reconfigurability measurement, which straightforwardly allows instantiation for system-specific application.},

The V2Anything App provides recommendations to the drivers about the FEV range autonomy, location of battery charging stations, information of the electricity market, and also a route planner, taking into account the public transportations and car or bike sharing systems. The main contributions of this application are related to the creation of an information and communication technology platform, recommender systems, data integration systems, driver profile, and personalized range prediction. Thus, it is possible to deliver relevant information to the FEV drivers related to the electric mobility process, the electricity market, the public transportation, and the FEV performance.},

  Abstract                 = {This work presents an improved deadbeat predictive current controller for grid-tie inverters that addresses issues related to implementation delays. The total delay is composed of the integer computational delay and a fractional delay, which is taken into account in the design of the controller algorithm, to improve its performance and robustness. The control strategy, based on a model that includes these delays, employs state feedback and a prediction observer in order to obtain a true two-sample ripple-free deadbeat response. System robustness can be adjusted with an appropriate selection of the location of the observer poles, at the expense of reducing control bandwidth. The proposed control scheme is both simple and computationally efficient since only few operations are required to include the delay in the algorithm. Experimental results show an improvement of the dynamic response even when mismatch in the load-inductance value estimation occurs.},

This study develops a methodology to maximize the production rate of a multifunction robot (MFR) operating within a rotationally arranged robotic cell. An MFR is able to perform additional special operations while in transit between transferring parts from adjacent processing stages. Considering the free-pickup scenario, the cycle time formulas are initially developed for small-scale cells where an MFR interacts with either two or three machines. A methodology for finding the optimality regions of all possible permutations is presented. The results are then extended to the no-wait pickup scenario in which all parts must be processed from the input hopper to the output hopper, without any interruption either on or between machines. This analysis enables insightful evaluation of the productivity improvements of MFRs in real-life robotized workcells.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless power transfer (WPT) has attracted an ever increasing interest from both industry and academics over the past few years. Its applications vary from small power devices such as mobile phones and tablets to high power electric vehicles and from small transfer distance of centimeters to large distance of tens of centimeters. In order to achieve a high-efficiency WPT system, each circuit should function at a high efficiency along with the proper impedance matching techniques to minimize the power reflection due to the impedance mismatch. This paper proposes an analysis on the system efficiency to determine the optimal impedance requirement for coils, rectifier, and dc-dc converter. A novel cascaded boost-buck dc-dc converter is designed to provide the optimal impedance matching in WPT system for various loads including resistive load, ultracapacitors, and batteries. The proposed 13.56-MHz WPT system can achieve a total system efficiency over 70% in experiment.},

  Abstract                 = {Motions of mobile robots need to be optimized to minimize their energy consumption to ensure long periods of continuous operations. Shortest paths do not always guarantee the minimum energy consumption of mobile robots. Moreover, they are not always feasible due to climbing constraints of mobile robots, especially on steep terrains. We utilize a heuristic search algorithm to find energy-optimal paths on hilly terrains using an established energy-cost model for mobile robots. The terrains are represented using grid-based elevation maps. Similar to A*-like heuristic search algorithms, the energy-cost of traversing through a given location of the map depends on a heuristic energy-cost estimation from that particular location to the goal. Using zigzag-like path patterns, the proposed heuristic function can estimate heuristic energy-costs on steep terrains that cannot be estimated using traditional methods. We proved that the proposed heuristic energy-cost function is both admissible and consistent. Therefore, the proposed path planner can always find feasible energy-optimal paths on any given terrain without node revisits, provided that such paths exist. Results of tests on real-world terrain models presented in this paper demonstrate the promising computational performance of the proposed path planner in finding energy-efficient paths.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a method for the job shop scheduling problem (JSSP) based on the hybrid metaheuristic method. This method makes use of the merits of an improved particle swarm optimization (PSO) and a tabu search (TS) algorithm. In this work, based on scanning a valuable region thoroughly, a balance strategy is introduced into the PSO for enhancing its exploration ability. Then, the improved PSO could provide diverse and elite initial solutions to the TS for making a better search in the global space. We also present a new local search strategy for obtaining better results in JSSP. A real-integer encode and decode scheme for associating a solution in continuous space to a discrete schedule solution is designed for the improved PSO and the tabu algorithm to directly apply their solutions for intensifying the search of better solutions. Experimental comparisons with several traditional metaheuristic methods demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed PSO-TS algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy efficiency is one of the most important factors that affect the applicability of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) in many practical scenarios. Many low-power media access control (MAC) protocols have been proposed in the past decade to improve the energy efficiency of sensor nodes. In these low-power MAC protocols, preambles are widely used to wake up the receivers asynchronizely. However, the data delivery potential of these preambles has not been exploited. In this paper, we propose a coded preamble (COPE), which exploits the data delivery potential of preambles by encoding the preambles by network coding. COPE has two salient features. First, a passive receiver set selection scheme enables nodes to decide whether to receive the overheard preamble packets, without introducing extra communication overhead. Second, COPE supports multiple routing primitives, such as unicast and broadcast, making it be a versatile 2.5 layer between the low-power link layer (layer 2) and the network layer (layer 3). We analyze COPE by a novel analytical model. Results show that COPE is able to improve the energy efficiency of both unicast and broadcast significantly. We also implement COPE in TinyOS/TelosB platform and evaluate its energy efficiency. Results show that COPE significantly reduces the radio-on-time in practical network settings.},

The existence of extensive camera networks and surveillance systems increases the amount of people images obtained, but, on the other hand, implies the need for new algorithms to enable reidentification of people captured by the cameras. There is no one optimal model that solves the entire problem, but a set of distinctive features can be used to help in the matching process. Our proposal consists of using the orientation of each person captured in the surveillance scene to considerably improve the reidentification process. An iterative algorithm maximizes the number of successful matches and speeds up the process. A comparison with other earlier relevant studies is presented using available datasets.},

Unlike traditional processes, the measured data in the plant-wide process pose great challenges to information capture, data management, and storage. More importantly, it is difficult to efficiently interpret the information hidden within those data. In this paper, the road map of a distributed modeling framework for plant-wide process monitoring is introduced. Based on this framework, the whole plant-wide process is decomposed into different blocks, and statistical data models are constructed in those blocks. For online monitoring, the results obtained from different blocks are integrated through the decision fusion algorithm. A detailed case study is carried out for performance evaluation of the plant-wide monitoring method. Research challenges and perspectives are discussed and highlighted for future work.},

Thus, in this paper, we make use of a software network platform, the cognitive packet network (CPN), to offer best-effort quality of service (QoS) to end users and to develop a new bilateral QoS differentiation between pairs of communicating nodes. In the proposed approach, each CPN edge or user node is a source and a destination at the same time, managing uplink user-originated traffic and downlink traffic sent back in response to the uplink. The bilateral communication is implemented with four distinct QoS objectives that can be met between sender nodes (original source or destination). Traffic volume asymmetry between the received and the sent data is used to trigger changes in QoS. The lower traffic rate requires short-delay QoS, whereas the higher traffic rate requires loss minimization. The effectiveness of the approach is evaluated by several measurements.},

  Abstract                 = {For simulating cyber-physical energy systems, distinct simulation domains need to be integrated for a comprehensive analysis of the interdependent subsystems. In particular, continuous time-based power system simulation and discrete event-based simulation of information and communication technology (ICT) networks are critical for investigating future smart grids. This paper presents the novel cosimulation environment INtegrated coSimulation of Power and ICT systems for Real-time Evaluation (INSPIRE) of power and ICT systems using the high-level architecture (HLA) (IEEE Std. 1516-2010). By applying the HLA standard, the environment is extendable to other simulation domains and a variety of functionalities and models, like thermal load models and additional third-party tools. Moreover, the HLA enables computational performance by distributed execution of each simulator on its own hardware and, thus, the applicability to realistic large-scale scenarios. INSPIRE has been designed under consideration of industrial standards [IEC 61850,object linking and embedding (OLE) for process control (OPC), and the common information model (CIM) (IEC 61968/61970)] in order to enhance interoperability, and to develop and validate solutions close to practice. The simulation results underline the interdependencies of power and ICT systems, and the necessity of an integrated analysis.},

Extensive performance tests motivate the choice of the service development framework, and prove the effectiveness of the special adapter software solution for the integration of current devices and the ability of the UA server to manage a high number of UA connections. As a proof-of-concept, the architecture has been tested for a real manufacturing problem composed of four flexible manufacturing systems. The results show that the architecture is able to efficiently control and monitor a real manufacturing process according to an optimized schedule with over 99% of the time spent on the manufacturing.},

The target models are intended for hardware-in-the-loop, i.e., closed-loop emulation using a model of the power converter implemented in digital hardware with the controller in its final implementation. The focus here is on the resolution of fixed-point models, although the results can also be applied to the significand resolution in floating-point representation. The first method is based on the simulation, provides the designer with the optimum resolution values, and guarantees that using the resolution, the converter will behave as it was specified. The second method is fast but conservative, intended for applications without hard constraints of area and speed. Despite the simplicity of the second method, its results, although slightly overestimated, have been demonstrated to be correct by the results of the first method. A boost converter for the power factor correction is used as an application example. As the converter model is intended for field-programmable gate array implementation, its area and maximum clock frequency are also analyzed. In this application example, the results show that the area grows linearly with the number of bits of each state variable, and the clock frequency is dominated by the width of one of the variables.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless sensor and actuator networks (WSAN) constitute an emerging technology with multiple applications in many different fields. Due to the features of WSAN (dynamism, redundancy, fault tolerance, and self-organization), this technology can be used as a supporting technology for the monitoring of critical infrastructures (CIs). For decades, the monitoring of CIs has centered on supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems, where operators can monitor and control the behavior of the system. The reach of the SCADA system has been hampered by the lack of deployment flexibility of the sensors that feed it with monitoring data. The integration of a multihop WSAN with SCADA for CI monitoring constitutes a novel approach to extend the SCADA reach in a cost-effective way, eliminating this handicap. However, the integration of WSAN and SCADA presents some challenges which have to be addressed in order to comprehensively take advantage of the WSAN features. This paper presents a solution for this joint integration. The solution uses a gateway and a Web services approach together with a Web-based SCADA, which provides an integrated platform accessible from the Internet. A real scenario where this solution has been successfully applied to monitor an electrical power grid is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents a distributed cooperative control scheme for voltage unbalance compensation (VUC) in an islanded microgrid (MG). By letting each distributed generator (DG) share the compensation effort cooperatively, unbalanced voltage in sensitive load bus (SLB) can be compensated. The concept of contribution level (CL) for compensation is first proposed for each local DG to indicate its compensation ability. A two-layer secondary compensation architecture consisting of a communication layer and a compensation layer is designed for each local DG. A totally distributed strategy involving information sharing and exchange is proposed, which is based on finite-time average consensus and newly developed graph discovery algorithm. This strategy does not require the whole system structure as a prior and can detect the structure automatically. The proposed scheme not only achieves similar VUC performance to the centralized one, but also brings some advantages, such as communication fault tolerance and plug-and-play property. Case studies including communication failure, CL variation, and DG plug-and-play are discussed and tested to validate the proposed method.},

The evaluation of the tradeoffs among the possible protocols for mutual exclusion requires an estimate of their implementation overheads. In this paper, we summarize the possible protection mechanisms and provide code implementations in real-time operating systems executing on a multicore platform. We discuss the tradeoffs among the different mechanisms based on experimental evaluation of their memory and timing overheads as well as their impact on system schedulability. We propose a heuristic algorithm to select the optimal combination of mechanisms for shared resources in systems with time constraints to minimize their memory requirements. The effectiveness of the optimization procedure is demonstrated by synthetic systems as well as industrial case studies.},

In addition, two other components are designed to support the composition process: building ontology as a schema for representing semantic data and composition plan description language to describe context-based composite services in form of composition plans.

  Abstract                 = {This paper discusses malicious false data injection attacks on the wide area measurement and monitoring system in smart grids. First, methods of constructing sparse stealth attacks are developed for two typical scenarios: 1) random attacks in which arbitrary measurements can be compromised; and 2) targeted attacks in which specified state variables are modified. It is already demonstrated that stealth attacks can always exist if the number of compromised measurements exceeds a certain value. In this paper, it is found that random undetectable attacks can be accomplished by modifying only a much smaller number of measurements than this value. It is well known that protecting the system from malicious attacks can be achieved by making a certain subset of measurements immune to attacks. An efficient greedy search algorithm is then proposed to quickly find this subset of measurements to be protected to defend against stealth attacks. It is shown that this greedy algorithm has almost the same performance as the brute-force method, but without the combinatorial complexity. Third, a robust attack detection method is discussed. The detection method is designed based on the robust principal component analysis problem by introducing element-wise constraints. This method is shown to be able to identify the real measurements, as well as attacks even when only partial observations are collected. The simulations are conducted based on IEEE test systems.},

The use of channel coding may decrease such packet loss; however, redundancy in channel coding also decreases the packet transmission rate although the bit rate remains the same. Thus, control systems are highly affected by disturbances. To improve control system quality, channel coding should be adaptively employed on the basis of packet loss and disturbances. Herein, an on-off error control coding scheme based on the communication and control layers is proposed. In this scheme, channel coding is adaptively used to minimize tracking errors in a controlled plant. Results demonstrate that the proposed on-off error control coding scheme improves the control system's reference tracking performance compared with that when using a fixed-rate coding scheme.},

Unlike existing works, the price fluctuation of both the wholesale and retail side of electricity market is considered, and the retailer can invest its wealth in electricity market and traditional financial market simultaneously. Hence, there is a complicated wealth dynamic, which is the main challenge in our work. In this paper, by utilizing the method of Lagrange multiplier and the classical Tchebycheff inequality, we first show that the investment problem is a quadratic programming problem in terms of the decision variable, and thus has a unique optimal solution. Then, a closed-form optimal solution is derived by solving the stationary equation and comparing the feasible solution interval. Based on the optimal solution, we find the key price, which will affect the investment is the wholesale price rather than the retail price. Moreover, with a similar analysis approach, we also provide the optimal solution considering a more general model, which allows the retailer to purchase the electricity temporarily to avoid the supply shortage. Extensive simulations demonstrate the better performance of the proposed solution over the Kelly strategy widely used in the financial market.},

  Abstract                 = {Imaging inspection is highly demanded in the optimization of industry processes. Optical imaging inspection is not applicable for inside defects, while infrared (IR) imaging inspection can provide information about internal structure of objects. Eddy current thermography is an emerging IR imaging inspection technique for conductive materials or objects. This paper presents eddy current volume heating thermography (ECVHT) and phase analysis for delamination inspection in carbon fiber reinforced plastics (CFRPs) based on the previously proposed eddy current pulsed phase thermography (ECPPT). The proposed method has been verified through experimental studies under both transmission and reflection modes. After discrete Fourier transform (DFT) of temperature responses, the phasegram and phase spectra can be used to image and characterize interface delamination in CFRP due to elimination of nonuniform heating effect and carbon fiber structures. With the whole temperature response processed by DFT, carbon fiber structures and delamination can be differentiated due to periodic oscillation of phase spectra. With temperature response in cooling phase processed by DFT, some characteristic features can be extracted to construct the new phase images according to the shape of phase spectra. In all, using ECVHT and phase analysis, imaging characterization for delamination can get much better performance than conventional visible optical inspection system and eddy current pulsed thermography.},

  Abstract                 = {In real-life applications of wireless sensor networks (WSNs), optimization of the network operation is required to extend its lifetime. A framework is proposed that enables practical development of centralized cluster-based protocols supported by optimization methods for the WSNs. Based on this framework, a protocol using harmony search algorithm (HSA), a music-based meta-heuristic optimization method, is designed and implemented in real time for the WSNs. It is expected to minimize the intra-cluster distances between the cluster members and their cluster heads (CHs) and optimize the energy distribution of the WSNs. The study of HSA cluster-based protocol is carried out in a real case where the WSNs equipped with the proposed protocol are deployed in an indoor environment to monitor the ambient temperature for fire detection. A comparison is made with the well-known cluster-based protocols developed for WSNs such as low-energy adaptive clustering hierarchy-centralized (LEACH-C) and a cluster-based protocol using Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering algorithm. Experimental results demonstrate that the proposed protocol using HSA can be realized in centralized cluster-based WSNs for safety and surveillance applications in building environments. From the obtained experimental test results, it can be seen that the WSNs lifetime has been extended using the proposed HSA protocol in comparison with that of LEACH-C and FCM protocols.},

An effective solution for VSTLF can facilitate real-time electricity deployment and improve its quality. In this paper, a novel approach to model the very short-term load of individual households based on context information and daily schedule pattern analysis is proposed. Several daily behavior pattern types were obtained by analyzing the time series of daily electricity consumption, and context features from various sources were collected and used to establish a rule set for use in anticipating the likely behavior pattern type of a specific day. Meanwhile, an electricity consumption volume prediction model was developed for each behavior pattern type to predict the load at a specific time point in a day. This study was concerned with solving the VSTLF for individual households in Taiwan. The proposed approach obtained an average mean absolute percentage error (MAPE) of 3.23% and 2.44% for forecasting individual household load and aggregation load 30-min ahead, respectively, which is more favorable than other methods.},

This work proposes an innovative dispatching mechanism, which can better these metrics by minimizing the cycle time, i.e., the mean time to produce a product, while avoiding any deadlock, i.e., no part can proceed due to circuit wait. Its prerequisite is liveness supervision; however, temporal information is associated to certain operation stages for the sake of performance evaluation and throughput maximization, i.e., to maximize the finished-part quantity per time unit. In the paradigm of Petri nets, we show the criticality to prioritize certain activities locally. Our method can well design ratio parameters among distinct processes to improve system productivity.},

This paper studies a holistic scheduling problem for handling real-time applications in time-triggered in-vehicle networks where practical aspects in system design and integration are captured. The contributions of this paper are multifold. First, it designs a novel scheduling algorithm, referred to as Unfixed Start Time (UST) algorithm, which schedules tasks and messages in a flexible way to enhance schedulability. In addition, to tolerate assignment conflicts and further improve schedulability, it proposes two rescheduling and backtracking methods, namely, Rescheduling with Offset Modification (ROM) and Backtracking and Priority Promotion (BPP) procedures. Extensive performance evaluation studies are conducted to quantify the performance of the proposed algorithm under a variety of scenarios.},

This paper proposes a novel inverse force function using sparse least squares support vector machines (LS-SVMs) to achieve nonlinear modeling for precise motion of a PSRM. The required training and testing sets of sparse LS-SVMs are first obtained from experimental measurement. A sparse LS-SVMs regression is further developed using training set to accurately model the inverse force function. Accordingly, the function is tested via the testing set to assess its feasibility.

At the same time, heuristic algorithms have emerged to be highly capable of handling those new optimization problems. In this work, a simulation-based optimization approach is proposed that enables investigation with metaheuristic algorithms for domain experts, where especially the power engineering point of view gets highlighted. HeuristicLab is demonstrated as a framework for optimization, which facilitates usage and development of optimization algorithms in a way that is attractive not only to computer scientists. From a software point of view, architectural aspects are treated that enable the decoupling of optimization algorithms and problems, which is a basic fundament of the framework. Further, interprocess communication is discussed that enables the interaction of optimization algorithms and simulation problems, and a practical showcase demonstrates the framework's application to real-world power grid optimization issues.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a full-digital ac-dc converter with power factor correction (PFC)-based on counting is presented. As for the digital output voltage information, it is obtained by injecting the positive and negative triangular wave into the sensed output voltage, comparing this resultant signal with the output voltage reference, and counting the low level of the resulting signal based on one counter in the field programmable gate array (FPGA). As for the digital inductor current information, it is obtained by comparing the positive sawtoothed wave with the sensed inductor current after filtering and counting the low level of the resulting signal based on another counter in the FPGA. On the other hand, the sinusoidal reference command for the current controller is obtained by triggering the sinusoidal table in the FPGA via the zero crossing detecting circuit. This sinusoidal reference command, together with the traditional average current control method, generates a suitable control effort to drive the power switch such that the output voltage is controlled at a desired value and at the same time the input current follows the input voltage as tightly as possible. Above all, the proposed sampling method can be applied to the continuous conduction mode (CCM), the discontinuous conduction mode (DCM), or both. Finally, some experimental results are offered to verify the effectiveness of the proposed sampling method.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a novel framework of coordinated voltage and frequency control strategy for islanded microgrid (MG) operation. The proposed control schemes rely on local measurements as communication-free control approach. Therefore, the distributed controllers of the MG components have been deployed based on their slow, medium, and fast dynamic responses to maintain the voltage and frequency in adherence to IEEE Standards 1547 and 929. The various voltage and frequency control responses associated with reactive power management scheme are efficiently utilized based on well-defined states of operation and transient management scheme. In each state, the roles of each device for voltage and frequency regulations are defined with its regulation capability, and response time based on its local measurements. Consequently, the fast reactive power compensation and rapid frequency regulation are ensured based on the inverter-based devices at challenging operating conditions. As a result, the proposed control strategy improves the voltage and frequency regulation, transient response, and MG stability. A comprehensive simulation study has verified the superior performance of the communication-free approach during steady state and in response to severe disturbances.},

In the considered setting, the order quantity is fixed and the instants of placing the order serve as the decision variable, which perfectly suits the switching input signals in DSM control systems. It is proved that, with the proposed nonlinear algorithm applied, the stock level does not exceed the assigned warehouse space.

In this context, simple regional predictions for the wind energy from the nearest location available can easily lead to unacceptable modeling errors. There is thus a need to develop a framework for predicting the values of the wind speed at the desired location. This work addresses the aforementioned issue by employing a multilayer feed-forward back-propagation neural network for classification that utilizes the global forecast system (GFS) predictions on wind speed and direction to identify patterns of the wind behavior at the location considered in order to obtain a stochastic distribution of the daily wind speed. The proposed approach aims to support the implementation of an enhanced energy box (EB) management decision tool, while its feasibility is demonstrated through a case example for a region in the south of Portugal.},

The hardware performance in contemporary 3-D scanning devices is suitable for online utilization. However, the bottleneck is the lack of real-time algorithms for recognition of geometric primitives (e.g., planes and natural quadrics) from a scanned point cloud. One of the most important and the most frequent geometric primitive in various engineering tasks is plane. In this paper, we propose a new fast one-pass algorithm for recognition (segmentation and fitting) of planar segments from a point cloud. To effectively segment planar regions, we exploit the orthonormality of certain wavelets to polynomial function, as well as their sensitivity to abrupt changes. After segmentation of planar regions, we estimate the parameters of corresponding planes using standard fitting procedures. For point cloud structuring, a z-buffer algorithm with mesh triangles representation in barycentric coordinates is employed. The proposed recognition method is tested and experimentally validated in several real-world case studies.},

Unit testing is one of the available approaches that is used to ensure that behavior of small software parts is consistent with requirements. It allows to improve software quality and decrease overall costs. Despite the fact that such an approach is commonly judged as a vital concept, it is not usual in control software. In this paper, the comprehensive approach to test the IEC 61131-3 software using unit tests is presented. It supports to create tests in two ways-either in textual and graphical IEC 61131-3 languages or in the CPTest+ dedicated test definition language. The latter is equipped with many advanced features, such as test fixtures and inclusions, parameterized and analog signal extensions, mock objects, as well as a few kinds of suites. The overall solution runs on the developer and testing station; hence, it does not have significant impact on performance of the control program and tests are more reliable and repeatable. To explain the concept, the simple running example is presented in this paper. The described solution has been introduced in the CPDev engineering environment for programming controllers.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet of Things (IoT) has provided a promising opportunity to build powerful industrial systems and applications by leveraging the growing ubiquity of Radio Frequency IDentification (RFID) and wireless sensors devices. Benefiting from RFID and sensor network technology, common physical objects can be connected, and are able to be monitored and managed by a single system. Such a network brings a series of challenges for data storage and processing in a cloud platform. IoT data can be generated quite rapidly, the volume of data can be huge and the types of data can be various. In order to address these potential problems, this paper proposes a data storage framework not only enabling efficient storing of massive IoT data, but also integrating both structured and unstructured data. This data storage framework is able to combine and extend multiple databases and Hadoop to store and manage diverse types of data collected by sensors and RFID readers. In addition, some components are developed to extend the Hadoop to realize a distributed file repository, which is able to process massive unstructured files efficiently. A prototype system based on the proposed framework is also developed to illustrate the framework's effectiveness.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we propose a semisupervised label consistent dictionary learning (SSDL) framework for machine fault classification. SSDL is a semisupervised extension of recent fully supervised label consistent dictionary learning approach, since the number of labeled machine data is usually limited in practice. To enable the supervised dictionary learning model to use both labeled and commonly readily available unlabeled data for enhancing performance, we propose to incorporate the merits of label prediction and present a joint label consistent dictionary learning and adaptive label prediction technique. In this setting, we first employ the existing label prediction model to estimate the labels of unlabeled training signals in a transductive fashion for enriching supervised prior. Then, we use predicted labeled data for label consistent dictionary learning. After that, we apply the discriminant sparse codes as the adaptive reconstruction weights for label prediction to update the estimated labels of unlabeled training data and the discriminative sparse codes matrix for label consistent dictionary learning so that classification performance can be enhanced. Thus, an informative dictionary, a sparse-code matrix, and an optimal multiclass classifier can be alternately obtained from one objective function. Besides, the tricky process of choosing optimal kernel width and neighborhood size can also be effectively voided in our scheme due to the adaptive weights. Extensive simulations on several machine fault datasets show that our SSDL method can deliver enhanced performance over other state-of-the-arts for machine fault classification.},

One of the main design difficulties derives from the need to accurately tune the resonant tank and the operating conditions to achieve the desired performance. This is especially challenging in those applications in which either the resonant tank or the operating conditions are highly variable. This paper proposes and compares several implementations of online parametric identification algorithms to identify the resonant tank of power converters taking advantage of field-programmable gate array technology. The proposed implementations are based on the phase-sensitive detector algorithm, which ensures an accurate harmonic identification of the resonant load. The proposed identification system is tested using a resonant power converter prototype applied to induction heating systems, proving the feasibility and accuracy of this proposal.},

  Abstract                 = {This work presents data mining methods for discovering unusual consumption patterns and their associated descriptive models from smart electricity meter data. At present, data mining and knowledge discovery in electricity meter data suffer from three notable weaknesses: 1) insufficient focus on intelligent data analysis of subgroups (subsets) whose patterns vary significantly from aggregate patterns embodied in an entire dataset; 2) a lack of effort towards generating intuitively understandable and practically applicable knowledge for industrial practitioners to identify such subgroups; and 3) limited knowledge regarding the link between unusual consumption patterns and household consumers' socio-demographic characteristics. This paper addresses these practically important but technically challenging issues by applying subgroup discovery algorithms to a real smart electricity meter dataset. Subgroups whose patterns are unusual and whose sizes are large enough are discovered, and their descriptive and predictive models are generated. Furthermore, to enrich subgroup discovery algorithms, three new-quality measures for real-valued targets are proposed. The comparative studies empirically evaluate the effectiveness and usefulness of subgroup discovery on classification accuracy, predictive power, and computational resources. The methodologies and algorithms presented are generic, and therefore applicable to a wider range of data mining problems.},

In this paper, probabilistic power estimation models of binary divider IP cores implemented in reconfigurable logic are presented. The models are ready for use at the algorithmic and RTL levels of the design flow and are simulation-independent, thus resulting in fast estimation times. The only parameters the model needs are the bit-widths of the operator inputs and their signal statistics: mean values, variances and autocorrelation coefficients. Based on these parameters and taking into account the particular logic structure of the binary divider cores, analytical probabilistic formulas are used to calculate the overall switching activity in the circuits-the main cause of dynamic power consumption. Estimates are compared with both real on-board measurements and estimates from the simulation-based tool XPower from Xilinx. Results show that the mean relative estimation errors are within 10% of on-board measurements or low-level estimates, and the average time to obtain power estimates using the proposed models is only 135 ms.},

  Abstract                 = {Recognition of human gestures plays an important role in a number of human-interactive applications, such as mobile phones, health monitoring systems, and human-assistive robots. Electromyography (EMG) is one of the most common and intuitive methods used for detecting gestures based on muscle activities. The EMG, however, is in general, too sensitive to environmental disturbances, such as electrical noise, electromagnetic signals, humidity, and so on. In this paper, a new method for recognizing the muscular activities is proposed based on air-pressure sensors and air-bladders. The muscular activity is detected by measuring the change of the air pressure in an air-bladder contacting the interested muscle(s). Since the change of the air pressure can be more robustly measured compared with the change of electric signals appeared on the skin, the proposed sensing method is useful for mobile devices due to its great signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and fast response time. The principle and applications of the proposed sensing method are introduced in this paper. The performance of the proposed method is evaluated in terms of linearity, repeatability, wear-comfort, etc., and is also verified by comparing it with an EMG signal and a motion sensor.},

The reactive capability of PV inverter combined with droop-based BES system is evaluated for rural and urban scenarios (having different mbi R/X ratios). Results show that reactive compensation from PV inverters alone is sufficient to maintain acceptable voltage profile in an urban scenario (low-resistance feeder), whereas coordinated PV and BES support is required for the rural scenario (high-resistance feeder). Constant, as well as variable, droop-based BES schemes are analyzed. The required BES sizing and associated cost to maintain the acceptable voltage profile under both schemes are presented. Uncertainties in PV generation and load are considered, with probabilistic estimation of PV generation and randomness in load modeled to characterize the effective utilization of BES.

  Abstract                 = {One of the most common deficiencies of currently existing induction motor fault diagnosis techniques is their lack of automatization. Many of them rely on the qualitative interpretation of the results, a fact that requires significant user expertise, and that makes their implementation in portable condition monitoring devices difficult. In this paper, we present an automated method for the detection of the number of broken bars of an induction motor. The method is based on the transient analysis of the start-up current using wavelet approximation signal that isolates a characteristic component that emerges once a rotor bar is broken. After the isolation of this component, a number of stages are applied that transform the continuous-valued signal into a discrete one. Subsequently, an intelligent icon-like approach is applied for condensing the relative information into a representation that can be easily manipulated by a nearest neighbor classifier. The approach is tested using simulation as well as experimental data, achieving high-classification accuracy.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper is focused on the design of a new approach dedicated to solve classification problems for the detection of broken rotor bar (BRB) fault in induction motors (IM). This new method finds its origins in a novel combination of both recursive undecimated wavelet packet transform (RUWPT) and directed acyclic graph support vector machines (DAG SVMs). Most often, BRB frequency components are hardly detected in the stator current due to its low magnitude and closeness to the supply frequency component. To overcome this drawback, the RUWPT is applied to extract one parameter able to detect the fault with arbitrary working conditions and a great concern of low load cases. Different multiclass support vector machines (MSVMs) methods are evaluated with respect to accuracy, number of support vectors, and testing time. The experimental results confirm that the DAG SVMs and Symlet wavelet kernel function are fast, robust, and give the best classification accuracy of 99%.},

As such, in industrial production of carbon fiber, this step is considered as a major bottleneck in the whole process. Stabilization process parameters are usually many in number and highly constrained, leading to high uncertainty. The goal of this paper is to study and analyze the carbon fiber thermal stabilization process through presenting several effective dynamic models for the prediction of the process. The key point with using dynamic models is that using an evolutionary search technique, the heat of reaction can be optimized. The employed components of the study are Levenberg-Marquardt algorithm (LMA)-neural network (LMA-NN), Gauss-Newton (GN)-curve fitting, Taylor polynomial method, and a genetic algorithm. The results show that the procedure can effectively optimize a given PAN fiber heat of reaction based on determining the proper values of heating ramp and temperature.},

Flexibility and adaptiveness are the key features of the proposed nonparametric optimal TR algorithm. Lower and upper firing strengths of rules as well as their consequent coefficients are fed into a neural network (NN). NN output is a crisp value that corresponds to the optimal defuzzified output of IT2FLSs. The NN type reducer is trained through minimization of an error-based cost function with the purpose of improving forecasting performance of IT2FLS models. Once the optimal NN-based type reducer is trained, IT2FLS models can be straightforwardly forecast the next-day load demand. Numerical testing using real load datasets indicate IT2FLS models equipped with the new optimal TR algorithm outperform IT2FLS models using traditional TR algorithms in terms of forecast accuracies. This benefit is achieved in no cost, as the computational requirement of the proposed optimal TR algorithm is the same as for traditional TR algorithms.},

The demand-side resources can be incentivized to alter their consumption patterns by varying their electricity price over time. A major residential energy demand contribution is from electric heating, which, when combined with smart energy storage using water heaters, could be utilized to defer consumption to more inexpensive periods without affecting the customer's thermal quality of service. The objective is to optimize the consumer electricity price of electric storage space heating customers, in order to maximize the profit of the retailer. This approach of varying the customer electricity prices leads to a game-theoretic scenario, where the procurement and consumption profiles of the retailer and consumer agents are based on the set electricity price. The optimization of the consumer electricity price is shown to offer lesser expense for the retailer. In addition, hourly load-following can be improved by offering further discounts for the consumers.},

  Abstract                 = {Mobile devices such as personal digital assistants (PDAs) and smartphones are widely used not only in our everyday lives but also in various industrial fields. Most of these mobile devices have multiple wireless network interfaces, such as Bluetooth, 3G, and Wi-Fi. A considerable amount of energy is consumed to transfer the data through wireless communication. Moreover, most of these mobile devices operate on limited battery power. In industrial environments, changes in the communication environment are severe due to significant noise sources and due to distortion in the transceiver circuitry of strong motors, static frequency changers, electrical discharge devices, and other devices. It is necessary to select the network interface efficiently in order to extend the lifetimes of mobile devices and their applications. Therefore, in this paper, we propose an energy-efficient adaptive wireless network interface-selection scheme (AWNIS). Our scheme is proposed based on the mathematical modeling of energy consumption and data transfer delay patterns. Our scheme selects the best wireless network interface in terms of energy consumption by considering the link quality and adapting a dynamic network interface-selection interval according to the network environment. The simulation results show that proposed scheme effectively improves the energy efficiency while guaranteeing a certain level of data transfer delay.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a polynomial-time algorithm for energy-efficient dynamic packet downloading from medical cloud storage to medical Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices. The medical cloud can distribute its own medical data to medical IoT devices via access points. Therefore, network disconnection can happen between the medical cloud and medical IoT devices when power/energy management in each access point is not efficient. This situation is especially harmful in in-hospital network architectures, because the architecture usually has strict requirements in terms of reliability. Therefore, this paper proposes a dynamic energy-efficient algorithm, which computes the amount of power allocation in each access point based on the buffer backlog size and channel states under the consideration of buffer stability. With the proposed adaptive algorithm, each access point calibrates its own parameters for more adaptive power/energy management. The performance of the proposed algorithm is evaluated in terms of network lifetime, and it is observed that the proposed algorithm achieves the desired performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Optimization-based methods have been recently proposed to solve motion planning problems with complex constraints. Previous methods have used optimization methods that may converge to a local minimum. In this study, particle swarm optimization (PSO) is proposed for trajectory optimization. PSO is a population-based stochastic global optimization method inspired by group behaviors in wildlife, and has the advantages of simplicity and fast convergence. Trajectory modifications are encoded in particles that are optimized with PSO. The normalized step cost (NSC) concept is used for the initialization of the particles in PSO. A method for reusing previously optimized parameters is also developed. The optimized parameters are stored together with corresponding NSC vectors, and when a constraint violation occurs, the parameters associated with an NSC vector that is similar to the query NSC vector are selected. The selected vector is used for initializing the particles. The reuse of the previously optimized parameters improves the convergence of the PSO in motion planning. The effectiveness of these methods is shown with simulations and an experiment using a three-dimensional problem with constraints. The proposed algorithm successfully optimized a trajectory while satisfying the constraints and is less likely to converge to a local minimum.},

  Abstract                 = {It is now well expected that low-power sensor networks will soon be deployed for a wide variety of applications. These networks could potentially have millions of nodes spread in complex indoor/outdoor environments. One of the major deployment challenges under such diverse communication environments is providing reliable communication links to those low cost and/or battery-powered sensor nodes. Over the past few years, research in physical (PHY)-layer has demonstrated promising progresses on link reliability and energy efficiency. In modern medium access control (MAC) design, energy efficiency has become one of the key requirements and is still a hot research topic. In this overview, we provide a broad view encompassing both PHY- and MAC-layer techniques in the field of sensor networks with a focus on link reliability and energy efficiency. We review work in systems employing various PHY techniques in spatial diversity, energy efficient modulation, packet recovery, and data fusion, as well as MAC protocols in contention-based duty cycling, contention-free duty cycling, and hybrid duty cycling. The latest developments in cross-layer MAC designs that leverage PHY-layer techniques are presented. We also provide a synopsis of recent development and evolution of sensor network applications in industrial communications.},

By utilizing the two voltages with variable durations, the two proposed MPCC methods can reduce steady-state current errors and decrease output current ripples without increasing the sampling frequency in comparison with the conventional MPCC method, despite only three distinctive output voltages being allowed in the single-phase VSI. The two proposed methods along with the conventional MPCC method are compared in terms of current errors and total harmonic distortion.

The main idea is to preselect voltage vectors to decrease switching losses at the next sampling period, and then select one optimum voltage vector among only the preselected voltage vectors to perform direct power control (DPC). The proposed vector preselection scheme enables a predefined cost function to consider only four vectors to control the real and the reactive power at every sampling period. The proposed MPDPC method using only the four preselected vectors stops switching operation of one leg exposed to the largest input current at every sampling period. On the basis of the preselected vectors at each sampling period, the proposed method can effectively reduce the switching losses, as well as accurately perform power control of the active rectifier.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the implementation on field-programmable gate arrays (FPGAs) of an embedded system for online signature verification. The recognition algorithm mainly consists of three stages. First, an initial preprocessing is applied on the captured signature, removing noise and normalizing information related to horizontal and vertical positions. Afterwards, a dynamic time warping algorithm is used to align this processed signature with its template previously stored in a database. Finally, a set of features are extracted and passed through a Gaussian Mixture Model, which reveals the degree of similarity between both signatures. The algorithm was tested using a public database of 100 users, obtaining high recognition rates for both genuine and forgery signatures. The implemented system consists of a vector floating-point unit (VFPU), specifically designed for accelerating the floating-point computations involved in this biometric modality. Moreover, the proposed architecture also includes a microprocessor, which interacts with the VFPU, and executes by software the rest of the online signature verification process. The designed system is capable of finishing a complete verification in less than 68 ms with a clock rated at 40 MHz.

  Abstract                 = {Available model-based networked control system (NCS) design approaches are basically formulated from the known system model and the information of the networked-induced delay time. Because the delay in remote control systems is significant and time-varied as commercial networks involved, available model-based NCS design approaches may thus become impractical. The increase of time delay due to the limited communication bandwidth usually induces data dropout to make NCS design even more difficult. In this paper, the scheme of the perfect delay compensation (PDC) is proposed by introducing the butterfly-shaped inner feedback loop in NCS to deal with the unknown network-induced time delay. Furthermore, analytical results indicate that the controller obtained in general control systems can be directly implemented on NCS with the proposed PDC scheme. Both simulation and experimental results were successfully carried out on an ac servo motor at a distance of 15 km through Ethernet to maintain a stable remote control system.},

To implement the digital cluster that displays all the meters (such as speed and fuel gauge) together with infotainment services (such as navigator and browser), the GPU needs to be virtualized; however, GPU virtualization for the digital cluster has not been addressed yet. This paper presents a Virtualized Automotive DIsplay (VADI) system to virtualize a GPU and its attached display device. VADI manages two execution domains: one for the automotive control software and the other for the in-vehicle infotainment (IVI) software. Through GPU virtualization, VADI provides GPU rendering to both execution domains, and it simultaneously displays their images on a digital cluster. In addition, VADI isolates GPU from the IVI software in order to protect it from potential failures of the IVI software. We implement VADI with Vivante GC2000 GPU and perform experiments to ensure requirements of International Standard Organization (ISO) safety standards. The results show that VADI guarantees 30 frames per second (fps), which is the minimum frame rate for digital cluster mandated by ISO safety standards even with the failure of the IVI software. It also achieves 60 fps in a synthetic workload.},

Regarding energy efficiency, however, previous methods did not take into account the scalability of IWASNs and thus performed inefficiently. In this paper, we propose FlexiCast, which presents a novel energy-efficient method to check the integrity of software objects. Sensor nodes can efficiently detect a modification in software objects sent by a base station or stored in neighboring nodes through authenticated fingerprints and network-wide attestation. Our analysis shows that FlexiCast can reduce energy consumption by 71% for both updating software objects and checking modifications regarding more critical attacks.},

  Abstract                 = {With the development of three-dimensional (3-D) display technologies, 3-D video has attracted more and more interest. Multiview video plus depth (MVD) is one of the most popular representation formats of 3-D video. In MVD coding system, multiview depth video needs to be coded and transmitted in addition to the texture video. This paper presents a novel fast mode decision (FMD) method for odd views in multiview depth video coding. First, the inter-view and inter-component coding correlations are analyzed to provide efficient reference information. Then, with a view to the characteristics of different types of frames, different early termination strategies are proposed. For the nonanchor frame, the early termination criterion is based on the rate-distortion cost information of the even views and the coded block pattern information. For the anchor frame, the criterion is set stricter to maintain the coding accuracy. Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce 78.07% coding time on average, without significant loss of video quality.},

  Abstract                 = {In distributed manufacturing systems, manufacturing resource composition is one of the most important problems. This is because efficiency of resource selection and resource utilization can all be improved if it is tackled well. However, most of the existing methods neglect temporal relationship between resources. This leads to an inefficient use of resources, because all resources have to be kept available before a business process is started. A temporal composition of resources is more suitable, as it expresses the scheduling and the flow of servicing to a business process. Therefore, resource services invoked in sequential order are called the resource-service chain (RSC), in view that distributed resources are encapsulated into cloud services in a cloud manufacturing (CMfg) environment. We propose an approach, called RSC composition algorithm (RSCCA) that can better cope with the temporal relationship between the resource services in a business process. Specifically, a two-stage composition method based on the degrees of dependency between resource services in workflow is proposed. To begin, in the build-time stage algorithm, RSCCA resolves initial compositions based on task relatedness and temporal dependencies between resource services, and then calculates the usage frequencies of ICs by mining workflow log at workflow runtime stage. Based on this, RSCCA can compose individual resource services as more than sets, especially as chains, allowing flow directions and dynamics to be considered. RSCCA has been tested with different data sets and the results show that it can be very promising.},

First, we design a new outer electromagnetic coil comparing with traditional inner coil structure, which can obtain miniature damper easily and control the magnetic field conveniently. Second, we apply silicon steel rather than carbon steel for MRF damper, which can improve the performance of response and demagnetization of the damper. The effectiveness of the innovative design is confirmed by experiments in this paper. The range of soft-landing load can be controlled from 18 to 55 N by adjusting the coil current from 0 to 0.8 A. Additionally, an impact force at the beginning can be eliminated using a modeled synchronous linear current, which indicates that the small-MRF damper has good soft-landing performance.

  Abstract                 = {Avionics Full Duplex Switched Ethernet (AFDX) is a standard proposed to implement deterministic networks by providing predictable performance guarantees. The determinism is enforced through the concept of Virtual Link, which defines a logical unidirectional connection between end systems. Although an upper bounded end-to-end delay can be obtained using analysis based on, e.g., network calculus, frame arrival uncertainty in destination End-System is a source of nondeterminism that introduces a problem with respect to real-time fault detection. In this paper, a mechanism based on frame insertion is proposed to enhance the determinism of frame arrival within AFDX networks. In order to mitigate network load increase due to frame insertion, a Sub-Virtual Link aggregation strategy, formulated as a multiobjective optimization problem, is introduced. In addition, a brute force algorithm, a greedy algorithm, and a greedy algorithm with preprocessing have been developed to find solutions to the optimization problem. Experiments are carried out and the obtained results confirm the validity and applicability of the developed approaches.},

  Abstract                 = {Wafer stage is an important mechatronic unit of industrial lithography tool for manufacturing integrated circuits. To overcome the inherent limitations of fix-gain feedback control and improve the servo performance, a performance-oriented variable-gain control strategy with accelerated iterative parameter tuning is proposed for an ultra-precision wafer stage. The variable-gain controller comprises a fix-gain proportional-integral-derivative (PID) controller and add-on variable-gain elements, which are the focus of this paper. Specifically, the add-on variable-gain elements are significantly designed based on the main tracking error sources and error frequency of different reference trajectory phases. A weighted two-norm regarding the performance indexes of wafer stages, i.e., moving average (MA) and moving standard deviation (MSD) of the tracking error, is synthesized as the objective function, and the data-driven Levenberg-Marquardt-based iterative parameter tuning scheme is employed to find the optimal parameter values of the proposed variable-gain controller. Furthermore, to improve the convergence rate, a multiparameter accelerated iterative method is developed based on Aitken's method. Finally, the proposed variable-gain control strategy is implemented on an ultra-precision wafer stage developed in our laboratory. Comparative experimental results demonstrate that the strategy performs best and achieves excellent improvement on both MA and MSD. During the scanning phase, MA and MSD are less than 1.02 and 2.35 nm, respectively. The proposed variable-gain control strategy is also suitable for other industrial applications.},

  Abstract                 = {In digitally controlled inverters, the output voltage and current contain high-frequency harmonics due to the switching process. Unfortunately, the sampling frequency is often less than twice the bandwidth of measurement signal. Then, the aliasing phenomenon is brought into the sampling process and some low-frequency alias signals which cause power quality deterioration are produced. This paper presents a quantitative analysis to reveal the characteristic of the aliasing phenomenon in digitally controlled inverters. Specifically, the magnitude of alias signal will drop to zero and the phase will be inversed with some special sampling delays. Two alias suppression methods are then proposed by controlling the sampling delay. Steady-state error and low-frequency harmonics are significantly decreased with the proposed methods. The proposed methods have little delay so that the system has a better dynamic performance. The theoretical analysis and alias suppression strategies are validated by experimental results.},

Existing statistical methods attempt to resolve the inconsistency, which requires adequate information to make decisions. Distributed consensus decision making (CDM) methods can provide an efficient and reliable means of synthesizing information by using a wider range of information than existing statistical methods. In this paper, we first discuss service composition for the IoT by minimizing the multi-parameter dependent matching value. Subsequently, a cluster-based distributed algorithm is proposed, whereby consensuses are first calculated locally and subsequently combined in an iterative fashion to reach global consensus. The distributed consensus method improves the robustness and trustiness of the decision process.},

To find discriminative features, a novel dimension reduction algorithm, referred to as the nearest and farthest distance preserving projection (NFDPP), is proposed for machine fault feature extraction and classification. With the NFDPP, both the nearest and farthest samples of the data manifold can be analyzed simultaneously to identify features leading to fault classification. Additionally, we denoise the features directly in the feature space to save computation time and storage space, and prove its equivalence to denoising the signals in the time domain. Through analysis of measured vibration data for bearings with different defects, it is demonstrated that the proposed NFDPP approach can effectively classify different bearing faults and identify the severity of the bearing ball defect, and the direct denoising of features yield a significant improvement in fault classification. The effectiveness of the proposed method is further validated in identifying compound faults in locomotive bearings in an industrial setting.},

  Abstract                 = {Data association is a fundamental problem in multisensor fusion, tracking, and localization. The joint compatibility test is commonly regarded as the true solution to the problem. However, traditional joint compatibility tests are computationally expensive, are sensitive to linearization errors, and require the knowledge of the full covariance matrix of state variables. The paper proposes a posterior-based joint compatibility test scheme to conquer the three problems mentioned above. The posterior-based test naturally separates the test of state variables from the test of observations. Therefore, through the introduction of the robot movement and proper approximation, the joint test process is sequentialized to the sum of individual tests; therefore, the test has O(n) complexity (compared with O(n2) for traditional tests), where n denotes the total number of related observations. At the same time, the sequentialized test neither requires the knowledge to the full covariance matrix of state variables nor is sensitive to linearization errors caused by poor pose estimates. The paper also shows how to apply the proposed method to various simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) algorithms. Theoretical analysis and experiments on both simulated data and popular datasets show the proposed method outperforms some classical algorithms, including sequential compatibility nearest neighbor (SCNN), random sample consensus (RANSAC), and joint compatibility branch and bound (JCBB), on precision, efficiency, and robustness.},

  Abstract                 = {Shape fitting, including straight line and ellipse fitting, plays an important role in the (cylinder-) shape control system of silicon single crystal growth, because the straight lines and ellipse in the crystal image contain the important horizontal circle center and diameter information. This information can be used as control variables so that the grown crystal approximates to a perfect cylinder, and thus can be used as high-quality source materials. In this paper, we develop new straight line and ellipse fitting algorithms. The key points are as follows. We formulate the two-dimensional (2-D) binary image into a single-snapshot array signal of a virtual sensor array, and casts the angle estimation problem of straight lines into the direction finding one of virtual incoming sources. Based on the virtual array manifold and potential incoming angles, the relevant over-complete dictionary is constructed, and thus a sparse regression problem is formed. To solve such a regression problem, we introduce the weight vector sparsity term into the conventional linear least-squares support vector regression framework to estimate the angles of these straight lines. Based on the estimated angles and potential offsets, another over-complete dictionary is constructed, and thus the image can be looked upon as the sparse representation of these dictionary atoms. Since the constructed dictionary is of the same size as the image, we use the compressed sensing theory to reduce the relevant dimensionality and then apply the aforementioned sparse regression method to obtain the relevant offsets of these straight lines. We derive a new second-order polynomial of ellipse equation to obtain the ellipse parameters to avoid the trival solution from the conventional polynomial model. Some simulation and experimental examples are given to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed algorithms.},

First, the characteristics and mathematical model of the saliency back-EMF-based proportional-integral-derivative (PID) torque observer with the mechanical model-based phase-lock-loop (PLL) for the estimation of the rotor flux angle and speed of the IPMSM are discussed. Then, a new saliency back-EMF-based MTPA control suitable for the implementation using digital signal processor (DSP) is introduced. Moreover, the saliency back-EMF-based rotor flux angle and speed estimation method using WFNN torque observer is proposed. Furthermore, detailed network structure and online learning algorithms of WFNN are described. Finally, the feasibility of the proposed control schemes is verified through experimental results.},

  Abstract                 = {Due to the increasing number of sensors deployed in modern vehicles, intra-vehicular wireless sensor networks (IVWSNs) have recently received a lot of attention in the automotive industry, as they can reduce the amount of wiring harness inside a vehicle. By removing the wires, car manufacturers can reduce the weight of a vehicle and improve engine performance, fuel economy, and reliability. In addition to these direct benefits, an IVWSN is a versatile platform that can support other vehicular applications as well. An example application, known as a side blind zone alert (SBZA) system, which monitors the blind zone of the vehicle and alerts the driver in a timely manner to prevent collisions, is discussed in this paper. The performance of the IVWSN-based SBZA system is evaluated via real experiments conducted on two test vehicles. Our results show that the proposed system can achieve approximately 95%-99% detection rate with less than 15% false alarm rate. Compared with commercial systems using radars or cameras, the main benefit of the IVWSN-based SBZA is substantially lower cost.},

However, the private data of the QR barcode lacks adequate security protection. In this article, we design a secret QR sharing approach to protect the private QR data with a secure and reliable distributed system. The proposed approach differs from related QR code schemes in which it uses the QR characteristics to achieve secret sharing and can resist the print-and-scan operation. The secret can be split and conveyed with QR tags in the distribution application, and the system can retrieve the lossless secret when authorized participants cooperate. General browsers can read the original data from the marked QR tag via a barcode reader, and this helps reduce the security risk of the secret. Based on our experiments, the new approach is feasible and provides content readability, cheater detectability, and an adjustable secret payload of the QR barcode.},

This paper presents a methodological framework based on optimization and simulation to integrate aggregate optimized plans for production and multimodal transportation with detailed dynamic distribution plans affected by demand uncertainty. The objective function of the optimization model considers supply, production, transportation, and CO2 emission costs, as well as collaboration over the multimodal network. Bill-of-materials and capacity constraints are included. A feedback between simulation and optimization is used to plan requirements for materials and components. Computational experiments are based on realistic instances. Results demonstrate that the framework can be effectively used to analyze cost-CO2 emission tradeoffs, effects of demand uncertainty, and collaborative distribution strategies on economic and environmental performance of the supply chain.},

With the fast growth of time series data, traditional methods for motif discovery are inefficient and not applicable to large-scale data. This work proposes an efficient Motif Discovery method for Large-scale time series (MDLats). By computing standard motifs, MDLats eliminates a majority of redundant computation in the related arts and reuses existing information to the maximum. All the motif types and subsequences are generated for subsequent analysis and classification. Our system is implemented on a Hadoop platform and deployed in a hospital for clinical electrocardiography classification. The experiments on real-world healthcare data show that MDLats outperform the state-of-the-art methods even in large time series.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a new spatial neighborhood-constrained linear coding strategy which realizes sparse representation is proposed for visual object tracking. Unlike conventional sparse and locality-constrained linear coding approaches that need an extra post-processing stage to incorporate the spatial layout information, the proposed coding strategy intrinsically embeds the spatial layout information into the coding stage. The proposed coding strategy can also be used to effectively realize joint sparse representation for different feature descriptors.

To utilize the limited resources efficiently, a novel event-based mechanism is proposed for the sensor node, such that only selected valuable data are broadcasted to its neighboring sensors via the wireless channel according to whether specific events happen. By resorting to graph theory and utilizing stochastic analysis methods, the filter parameters and the event triggering rules are designed, such that the filtering error converges at an exponential rate in the mean square sense. An adaptive algorithm for determining the triggering threshold is developed, which allows the intelligent sensors to tune the boundary of a local event domain in an online manner, so as to keep the average transmission rate level off a desired value. An illustrative example is given to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed strategy.},

Furthermore, the thermal behaviors of batteries are difficult to predict, as their dynamics are strongly time-varying. In this paper, a hybrid model is developed for spatiotemporal estimation of temperature distribution in lithium-ion batteries. A simple but effective nominal model is first developed for real-time thermal management using a time/space separation method. Subsequently, a data-based neural model is proposed to compensate the model-plant mismatch caused by the spatial nonlinearity and other model uncertainties.

CHOKeR enhances the drawing factor by using a multistep increase and single-step decrease (MISD) mechanism. In order to explain the features of CHOKeR, an analytical model is used, followed by extensive simulations to evaluate the performance of CHOKeR. The analytical model and simulation results demonstrate that CHOKeR achieves proportional bandwidth allocation between different priority levels, fairness guarantee among equal priority flows, and protection of TCP against high-speed unresponsive flows when network congestion occurs.},

This trend is more obvious in the telecommunications industry, where companies become increasingly digitalized. Customer churn prediction is a main feature of in modern telecomcommunication CRM systems. This research conducts a real-world study on customer churn prediction and proposes the use of boosting to enhance a customer churn prediction model. Unlike most research that uses boosting as a method to boost the accuracy of a given basis learner, this paper tries to separate customers into two clusters based on the weight assigned by the boosting algorithm. As a result, a higher risk customer cluster has been identified. Logistic regression is used in this research as a basis learner, and a churn prediction model is built on each cluster, respectively. The result is compared with a single logistic regression model. Experimental evaluation reveals that boosting also provides a good separation of churn data; thus, boosting is suggested for churn prediction analysis.},

However, obtaining this model has proven difficult due to a variety of the raw forgings produced by manufacturing error, material variation, geometric defects, etc. In this paper, a novel online probabilistic extreme learning machine (ELM) is proposed to model batch forging processes. A probabilistic ELM is first developed to extract the distribution information of the batch forging processes from the data. Due to the highly linear structure of the ELM, the stochastic property of the forging process is easily derived and processed. By using the characteristics of the online ELM, a strategy is then developed to update the distribution model as new forging process data are collected.

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic security assessment (DSA) is an important issue in modern power system security analysis. This paper proposes a novel pattern discovery (PD)-based fuzzy classification scheme for the DSA. First, the PD algorithm is improved by integrating the proposed centroid deviation analysis technique and the prior knowledge of the training data set. This improvement can enhance the performance when it is applied to extract the patterns of data from a training data set. Secondly, based on the results of the improved PD algorithm, a fuzzy logic-based classification method is developed to predict the security index of a given power system operating point. In addition, the proposed scheme is tested on the IEEE 50-machine system and is compared with other state-of-the-art classification techniques. The comparison demonstrates that the proposed model is more effective in the DSA of a power system.},

In this paper, we focus on minimizing energy consumption and maximizing network lifetime for data relay in one-dimensional (1-D) queue network. Following the principle of opportunistic routing theory, multihop relay decision to optimize the network energy efficiency is made based on the differences among sensor nodes, in terms of both their distance to sink and the residual energy of each other. Specifically, an Energy Saving via Opportunistic Routing (ENS_OR) algorithm is designed to ensure minimum power cost during data relay and protect the nodes with relatively low residual energy. Extensive simulations and real testbed results show that the proposed solution ENS_OR can significantly improve the network performance on energy saving and wireless connectivity in comparison with other existing WSN routing schemes.},

LF-based CF models rely on an optimization process with respect to some desired latent features; however, most of them employ first-order optimization algorithms, e.g., gradient decent schemes, to conduct their optimization task, thereby failing in discovering patterns reflected by higher order information. This work proposes to build a new LF-based CF model via second-order optimization to achieve higher accuracy. We first investigate a Hessian-free optimization framework, and employ its principle to avoid direct usage of the Hessian matrix by computing its product with an arbitrary vector. We then propose the Hessian-free optimization-based LF model, which is able to extract latent factors from the given incomplete matrices via a second-order optimization process. Compared with LF models based on first-order optimization algorithms, experimental results on two industrial datasets show that the proposed one can offer higher prediction accuracy with reasonable computational efficiency. Hence, it is a promising model for implementing high-performance recommenders.},

  Abstract                 = {Matrix-factorization (MF)-based approaches prove to be highly accurate and scalable in addressing collaborative filtering (CF) problems. During the MF process, the non-negativity, which ensures good representativeness of the learnt model, is critically important. However, current non-negative MF (NMF) models are mostly designed for problems in computer vision, while CF problems differ from them due to their extreme sparsity of the target rating-matrix. Currently available NMF-based CF models are based on matrix manipulation and lack practicability for industrial use. In this work, we focus on developing an NMF-based CF model with a single-element-based approach. The idea is to investigate the non-negative update process depending on each involved feature rather than on the whole feature matrices. With the non-negative single-element-based update rules, we subsequently integrate the Tikhonov regularizing terms, and propose the regularized single-element-based NMF (RSNMF) model. RSNMF is especially suitable for solving CF problems subject to the constraint of non-negativity. The experiments on large industrial datasets show high accuracy and low-computational complexity achieved by RSNMF.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy mix (EM) is a term used to describe a share of different technologies used to meet the demand for electric power and energy. Development of EM is driven by many factors such as economic constraints, technical constraints, environmental requirements, and policy aspects. Therefore, the design of a proper EM is a demanding task, and requires adequate methodology and sophisticated modeling tools. The natural approach to defining the EM is application of optimization methodology. The majority of existing models is based on linear programming (LP). It enables the calculation of the total capacity by technology in a whole power system, but does not allow for estimation of the rated power of a particular power generating unit. Additionally, such an approach limits the development of model to include electrical grid constraints, detailed economic analyses, and consideration of rules of electricity market and power system operation. More sophisticated approaches are based on mixed integer linear programming (MILP). This paper deals with a problem of computational efficiency in MILP formulation of EM optimization. It presents three methods of formulation of binary variables for EM. The first method is based on unit commitment (UC) binary formulation. The second one implements an improvement on UC programming, while the third method introduces a novel approach for binary modeling of EM optimization. This paper delivers detailed mathematical formulations of the methods analyzed, and their evaluation in terms of computational performance and accuracy.},

The CDR scheme is formulated as a constrained optimization problem that generates a Pareto-optimal response strategy profile for consumers. Comparing with the noncooperative response strategy (i.e., Nash equilibrium) obtained from the one-shot demand management game, the Pareto-optimal response strategy reduces the electricity costs to the consumers. We further develop an incentive-compatible trigger-and-punishment mechanism to avoid the noncooperative behaviors of the selfish consumers. Furthermore, the CDR scheme is applied to achieve load management of industrial refrigerated warehouses. To implement the CDR scheme in large-scale systems, we group the refrigerated warehouses into clusters and utilize the CDR scheme within each cluster. Numerical results demonstrate that the CDR scheme can reduce the electricity costs, drop the electricity prices, and curtail the total energy consumption in comparison with the noncooperative demand response scheme.},

It is fully distributed in the sense that there is no need for a specialized/central controller to coordinate the operations of the autonomous local controllers (agents). Compared with centralized solutions, the multiagent system-based distributed solution is more reliable against single-point failures and can better accommodate customer participation. The proposed solution has been tested with a 5-bus system and the IEEE 30-bus system under light- and heavy-load conditions. Both static optimization and dynamic simulation results are provided to demonstrate the performance of the proposed solution.},

  Abstract                 = {Field programmable gate array (FPGA) implementation of a model predictive control with constant switching frequency (MPC-CSF) for a permanent magnet synchronous machine (PMSM) is proposed. The basic finite states MPC (FS-MPC) can be combined with a pulsewidth modulation (PWM) modulator because of an effective cost function optimization algorithm in which voltage vectors are dynamically selected and calculated through iteration based on the idea similar to dichotomy. Using model-based design (MBD), MPC-CSF is implemented on an FPGA with parallel and pipeline processing techniques in short execution time. Functionality simulation analysis presents that MPC-CSF is much robust to parameter variations. Experimental results illustrate that MPC-CSF has good dynamic performance for PMSM drives.},

  Abstract                 = {Large-scale integration of renewable energies causes a higher degree of volatility and uncertainty of power flows in the electrical transmission system in Europe, and thus a higher risk of cascading line outages possibly leading to blackouts. At the same time, the transformation of the power system into a cyber-physical system deploying evolved information and communication technology (ICT) solutions offers the opportunity to meet this challenge efficiently by intelligent control approaches instead of ample security reserves. In this paper, a novel approach for a distributed real-time coordination of power flow control is presented. For this, a multiagent system located decentrally at the substation level has been developed only relying on local measurements and interagent communication in contrast to global system models and centralized computations. Based on updated information received from neighboring agents, the agents quickly adapt to changing network situations and relieve overloads by coordinated action of power flow controlling (PFC) devices. For smoothing control behavior and for avoiding excitation of system oscillations, the extent of control actions also adapts to the severity of the network situation. For two study cases-examining the control system in the IEEE 39-bus 10-machine reference system and a large-scale model of the Western European transmission system-the performance of the multiagent system and ICT requirements is evaluated based on a co-simulation of the multiagent system and an electromechanical power system simulation.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes how to establish performance charts for selection of network parameters for effective utilization of a bilateral teleoperated manipulator working under a wireless communication channel. The goal is to construct a set of charts that help researchers and engineers to select appropriate parameters of wireless network setup for a known configuration of environment obstruction. To achieve this goal, a teleoperated setup comprising a master haptic device, a slave manipulator dynamic simulator, and a communication channel emulated using the network simulator version 2 (NS2) simulator is first developed. Next, performance indices are defined to evaluate the quality of position tracking of the slave manipulator end-effector and force tracking of the master haptic. Three indices chosen in this paper are the integral of squared position and force errors, the integral of absolute position and force error, and the amplitude of position and force overshoot. Extensive experiments on the developed setup are then conducted to study effects of time-varying packet loss on the performance of the teleoperated system. The largest mean packet loss, at which the system exhibits satisfactory tracking, is then quantified. This packet loss is used as an indicator to define regions representing the quality of tracking. The effectiveness of the proposed technique is validated by testing a fully instrumented hydraulically actuated system under various real wireless channel scenarios.},

Therefore, the minimization of energy consumption and the maximization of network lifetime are key objectives in WSN. This paper proposes an overlay, energy optimized, sensor network to extend the functional lifetime of an energy-intensive sensor network application. The overlay network consists of additional nodes that exploit recent advances in energy harvesting and wake-up radio technologies, coupled with an application specific, complementary, ultra-low power sensor. The experimental results and simulations demonstrate that this approach can ensure survivability of energy-inefficient sensor networks. Simulating applications using energy-intensive video cameras and air quality sensors, combined with the proposed overlayed ultra-low power sensor network, demonstrates that this approach can increase functional lifetime toward perpetual operation and is suitable for WSN applications in which complementarity exists between the required energy-intensive sensors and low-cost sensors that can be used as triggers.},

  Abstract                 = {In distributed systems, clock synchronization performance is hampered by delays and jitter accumulated not only in the network, but also in the timestamping procedures of the devices being synchronized. This is particularly critical in software timestamp-based synchronization where both software- and hardware-related sources contribute to this behavior. Usually, these synchronization impairments are collapsed into a black-box performance figure without quantifying the impact of each individual source, which obscures the picture and reduces the possibility to find optimized remedies. In this study, for the first time, the individual sources of delay and jitter are investigated for an IEEE 802.11 wireless local area network (WLAN) synchronization system using the IEEE 1588 protocol and software timestamps. Novel measurement techniques are proposed to quantify the hardware- and software-related delay and jitter mechanisms. It is shown that the delays and their associated jitter originate from both the WLAN chipset and the host computer. Moreover, the delay from the chipset cannot be considered symmetric and any such assumption inevitably leads to a residual offset, and thus to synchronization inaccuracy. Therefore, a calibration-based approach is proposed to compensate for these delays and to improve the performance of WLAN synchronization. Experimental results show that with optimal error compensation, a similar synchronization performance as software-based synchronization in Ethernet networks can be achieved.},

For this interactive user application, the total time for accessing the database, processing the data, and making the prediction needs to be within a few seconds. We first analyze three relatively fast machine learning-based time series prediction algorithms and find that the nearest neighbor (NN) algorithm (k NN with k = 1) shows better accuracy. Considering the sparseness of the time series of the charging records, we then discuss the new algorithm based on the new proposed time-weighted dot product (TWDP) dissimilarity measure to improve the accuracy and processing time. Two applications have been designed on top of the proposed prediction algorithm: one predicts the expected available energy at the outlet and the other one predicts the expected charging finishing time. The total time, including accessing the database, data processing, and prediction is approximately 1 s for both applications. The granularity of the prediction is 1 h and the horizon is 24 h; data have been collected from 20 EV charging outlets.},

So far, sampled-data modeling and sensitivity analysis are mostly used for such a purpose. In both cases, the switching conditions implicitly appear in the small-signal matrices which increases the complexity of the computation for the system with a larger number of topological modes. Here, we propose an alternative approach based on Filippov's method, which studies the effects of each switching separately. It uses a shooting method with an event detector to locate a periodic steady-state, and, when the Newton-Raphson search process of the shooting method converges, it also gives the Jacobian matrix. The algorithm can be easily implemented in a software program as an analytical tool which is expected to be useful for fast and accurate frequency-domain analysis (by small-signal transfer functions) to facilitate controller design. Moreover, since it uses the Filippov's method, this algorithm can also predict the slow- and fast-timescale instabilities.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, we introduce the concept of a bottleneck-routers cooperation in the explicit rate-control framework of communication networks in order to mitigate congestion effects on the network performance and balance the queues. The proposed controller at each router (server or switch) regulates the rates of the heterogeneous source classes leveraging on the cooperation of neighboring bottlenecks. We consider the model of multibottleneck network in the presence of time delay and formulate global stability conditions suitable for network parameters and controller gains design. The proposed approach guarantees good performance in terms of link utilization, packet loss and fairness. Additionally it is guaranteed queue balancing without requiring rerouting or hop-by-hop operation differently from the existing approaches. A validation is carried out by a discrete packet experiment simulator in a realistic multibottleneck scenario to demonstrate the effectiveness of the key idea of the paper. Finally the proposed scheme is compared to some of well-known network controller-type presented in the literature in both steady-state and dynamic network scenario.},

  Abstract                 = {Strict reliability and delay requirements of factory monitoring and control applications pose challenges for wireless communications in dynamic and cluttered industrial environments. To reduce outage in such fading-rich areas, cooperative relays can be used to overhear source-destination transmissions and forward data packets that a source fails to deliver. This paper presents the results of an experimental study of selective cooperative relaying protocols that are implemented in off-the-shelf IEEE 802.15.4-compatible devices and evaluated in an industrial production plant. Three practical relay update schemes, which define when a new relay selection is triggered, are investigated: 1) periodic; 2) adaptive; and 3) reactive relay selections. The results show that all relaying protocols outperform conventional time diversity retransmissions in delivery ratio and number of retransmissions for packet delivery. Reactive selection provides the best overall delivery ratio of nearly 99% over the tested network. There is a tradeoff, however, between achievable delivery ratio and required selection overhead. This tradeoff depends on protocol and network parameters, and is studied via protocol emulation using empirical channel values.},

  Abstract                 = {In resource-constrained devices such as RFID tags or implantable medical devices, algorithm designers need to make careful choices to ensure that their proposals are sufficiently efficient for the target platform. A common way of expressing such restrictions is in terms of an upper bound for the maximum available footprint area in gate equivalents (GE). For example, RFID tags conforming to standards EPC Class-1 Generation-2 and ISO/IEC 18000-6C can devote up to 4K GE to security functions. However, in most cases, algorithm designers are not hardware experts, nor they have any quantitative means to find out how much area their designs would occupy in a given technology. In this paper, we attempt to fill this gap by providing an estimate of the upper bound for the footprint area of any algorithm. Our approach takes into account the main components of such algorithms, namely, basic arithmetic/logic operations and additional hardware such as registers and multiplexers. We believe that our proposal can help designers in making informed decisions about what kind of algorithmic structures can be afforded for a target environment.},

The design of new true random generators (TRNGs) has attracted the attention of the research community for many years. Designs with little hardware requirements and high throughput are demanded by new and powerful applications. In this paper, we introduce the design of a novel TRNG based on the coherent sampling (CS) phenomenon. Contrary to most designs based on this phenomenon, ours uses self-timed rings (STRs) instead of the commonly employed ring oscillators (ROs). Our design has two key advantages over existing proposals based on CS. It does not depend on the FPGA vendor used and does not need manual placement and routing in the manufacturing process, resulting in a highly portable generator. Our experiments show that the TRNG offers a very high throughput with a moderate cost in hardware. The results obtained with ENT, DIEHARD, and National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) statistical test suites evidence that the output bitstream behaves as a truly random variable.},

  Abstract                 = {Cyber-physical technologies enable event-driven applications, which monitor in real-time the occurrence of certain inherently stochastic incidents. Those technologies are being widely deployed in cities around the world and one of their critical aspects is energy consumption, as they are mostly battery powered. The most representative examples of such applications today is smart parking. Since parking sensors are devoted to detect parking events in almost-real time, strategies like data aggregation are not well suited to optimize energy consumption. Furthermore, data compression is pointless, as events are essentially binary entities. Therefore, this paper introduces the concept of Lean Sensing, which enables the relaxation of sensing accuracy at the benefit of improved operational costs. To this end, this paper departs from the concept of instantaneous randomness and it explores the correlation structure that emerges from it in complex systems. Then, it examines the use of this system-wide aggregated contextual information to optimize power consumption, thus going in the opposite way; from the system-level representation to individual device power consumption. The discussed techniques include customizing the data acquisition to temporal correlations (i.e, to adapt sensor behavior to the expected activity) and inferring the system-state from incomplete information based on spatial correlations. These techniques are applied to real-world smart-parking application deployments, aiming to evaluate the impact that a number of system-level optimization strategies have on devices power consumption.},

  Abstract                 = {The control strategies that use modulation techniques have great acceptance in the current control of static power converters. Indeed, they offer a wide variety of alternatives to address the steady-state characteristics required by the system. Nevertheless, its computation and modulation delay negatively affects its dynamic performance. In order to improve the time response of the system, the modulator is avoided and the strategies of direct choice of the switching state have been presented. They can provide a very fast dynamic response; however, the absence of switching state sequences makes more complex the task of establishing specific switching features for improved steady-state performance. In this work, a control scheme that selects a specific control strategy according to the operating condition of the system is proposed. This allows using modulators to satisfy the switching characteristics required in steady-state and avoids its use when a rapid dynamic response is required. In addition, a soft transition method between the control strategies is presented to prevent unwanted behaviors when these are alternated. The proposed control scheme allows simplifying the design and keeps the main advantages of each selected strategy. To validate the scheme, experimental results are obtained for a control structure that alternates between a finite set model predictive control (direct type for rapid dynamic response) and a proportional integral (PI) control with sinusoidal pulse width modulation (SPWM) (modulated type for high steady-state performance).},

However, the total harmonic distortion (THD) of input line current in 12-pulse rectifier does not meet the IEEE-519 standard. In order to reduce the harmonics to an acceptable level, we use a two-stage auxiliary circuit at dc side of the 12-pulse rectifier to eliminate harmonics actively. The effect of the auxiliary circuit's parameter on the system performance is analyzed first, which indicates the necessity of applying two-stage auxiliary circuit. The front-stage auxiliary circuit plays a role in producing circulating current to cancel harmonics, and the back stage adjusts the output voltage of the front stage and feeds the power absorbed by the front stage to load in accordance with load current and input voltage of 12-pulse rectifier. Besides the good performance in harmonic elimination, the proposed auxiliary circuit has low kilovolt ampere rating.},

  Abstract                 = {This work introduces a multidomain simulation platform that enables a holistic analysis of city district scale energy systems. The objective for the development of the simulation platform is to provide a tool that supports the design of control and energy management algorithms for those systems. The platform allows long-term simulations of a large number of buildings, including internal energy supply or energy conversion systems, in combination with external energy supply systems like the electrical grid. The simulation of those physical systems represents the environment for sophisticated control and energy management algorithms that can be tested on the platform. The concept of this work is to combine commercial-off-the-shelf software packages, here simulators and runtime infrastructure (RTI), to a high performance multidomain cosimulation platform. The high performance of the platform regarding computation time has been achieved by exploiting the parallel computing capabilities of modern simulation servers. Especially the computation time of large numbers of instances of Modelica-based models has been reduced significantly by the development of the parallel execution framework (PEF). The implementation of the PEF, including the interface to the individual models and to the RTI, is described in detail. The partitioning of the simulated system among different simulators does not influence the simulation results, as shown on the basis of a small-scale simulation scenario. The performance regarding the computation time is demonstrated on several example simulation scenarios showing the scalability of the platform.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper presents the multilevel A-diakoptics methodology (diakoptics based on actors) for the dynamic load-flow simulation of hybrid distribution systems (DSs), which are power systems working at different base frequencies. In the development of the smart grid, several challenges have been identified, such as the connection of nonconventional loads, distributed generators, and interoperability between power systems working at different frequencies. These challenges have led to use simulations for designing and developing the future grid. Additionally, computer hardware architectures have evolved to allow modeling the real world more accurately. However, the existing simulation methods for power-flow analysis are not compatible with parallel and concurrent processing, subusing the existing computer power. Our approach called A-Diakoptics combines the power of Diakoptics and the Actor model to make any conventional power-flow analysis method suitable for multithread processing. As a result, the nature and complexity of the power system can be modeled without affecting the computing time, even if several parts of the power system operate at very far modes or bandwidths such as in the case of dc microgrids. This method is an advanced strategy for simulating large DSs in unbalanced conditions, covering the basic needs for the implementation of multiscale grid dynamics.},

The performance of communication has a significant effect on the performance of the controllers that manage a power system.

Such strategies should describe what needs to be communicated when and between which nodes.

  Abstract                 = {New challenges are arising in managing power systems as these systems become more complex due to the use of high levels of distributed generation, mainly based on renewable energy sources, and due to the competitive environment within the power sector.

One of the challenges in the near future is converting the high quantity and quality of information provided by PMUs into useful knowledge about operational state of a global system. The use of real-time simulation in closed loop is essential to develop and validate new real-time applications of wide-area PMU data. This paper presents a simulation platform developed within the research project Secure Operation of Sustainable Power Systems (SOSPO). The SOSPO simulation platform (SOSPO-SP) functions in a closed loop integrating new real-time assessment methods to provide useful information to operators in power system control centers, and to develop new control methodologies that handle emergency situations and avoid power system blackouts.},

The use of Petri nets (either low-level or high-level classes) extended with asynchronous-channels (ACs), time domains, priorities, inputs, and outputs is proposed in this paper to model GALS-DES (composed by deterministic components), ensuring that the created GALS model is locally deterministic, distributable, network-independent, and platform-independent. The proposed ACs, with high level of abstraction, specify the components interaction through Petri net objects with specific attributes that unambiguously identify this interaction within the GALS model. Two algorithms are proposed to translate and decompose the GALS model into Petri net models without ACs, which can be used as inputs in model-checking tools and automatic code generators supporting GALS-DES verification and implementation. The specification of a small goods lift distributed controller illustrates the use of the proposed ACs.},

However, the GMM cannot properly model noisy or nonstationary backgrounds and fails to discriminate between the foreground and background modes. The extensions to GMM provide increased accuracy in expense of complex implementation and reduced applicability. In response, this work proposes two simple improvements: 1) a novel distance measure based on local support weights and histogram of gradients to provide distinct cluster values; and 2) use of background layer concept to properly segment the foreground. The method also uses variable number of clusters for generalization. The main advantages of the method are implicit use of pixel relationships through distance measure with least modification to the conventional GMM and effective background noise removal through the use of background layer concept with no postprocessing involved. The extensive experimentations on various types of video sequences are performed to validate the improvement in accuracy compared to the GMM and a number of state-of-the-art methods.},

Since energy consumption depends also on packet transmission rate, especially during attacks, we also propose to adapt it according to instantaneous control performance.},

  Abstract                 = {The massive use of information and communication technologies in supervisory control and data acquisition (SCADA) systems opens new ways for carrying out cyberattacks against critical infrastructures relying on SCADA networks. The various vulnerabilities in these systems and the heterogeneity of cyberattacks make the task extremely difficult for traditional intrusion detection systems (IDS). Modeling cyberattacks has become nearly impossible and their potential consequences may be very severe. The primary objective of this work is to detect malicious intrusions once they have already bypassed traditional IDS and firewalls. This paper investigates the use of machine learning for intrusion detection in SCADA systems using one-class classification algorithms. Two approaches of one-class classification are investigated: 1) the support vector data description (SVDD); and 2) the kernel principle component analysis. The impact of the considered metric is examined in detail with the study of lp-norms in radial basis function (RBF) kernels. A heuristic is proposed to find an optimal choice of the bandwidth parameter in these kernels. Tests are conducted on real data with several types of cyberattacks.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper introduces a novel framework for industrial wireless sensor networks (IWSNs) used for machine condition monitoring (MCM). Our approach enables the use of state-of-the-art computationally intensive classifiers in computationally weak sensor network nodes. The key idea is to split data acquisition, classifier building and training, and the operation phase, between different units. Computationally demanding processing is carried out in the central unit, while other tasks are distributed to the sensor nodes using over-the-air programming. The system is autonomously trained on the healthy state of a machine and then monitors a change in behavior which indicates a faulty state. Thanks to one-class classification, there is no need to introduce the faulty state of the machine in the training phase. We extend the diagnostic capability of the system using dynamic changes in the data acquisition and classification parts of the program in the sensor nodes. This enables the system to react to ambiguous machine states by temporarily changing the diagnostic focus. Compressing the information in the individual sensor nodes provided by in-node classification allows us to transmit only the classification result, instead of full signal waveforms. This enables the MCM system to be deployed with a large number of nodes, even with high sampling rates. The proposed concept was evaluated in IRIS IWSN by means of a rotary machine simulator.},

However, they are yet to be practical due to high scheduling overhead in mobile, radio-unfriendly, mining environments. A new decentralized relay-assisted multiuser MIMO approach is proposed, which cuts the overhead by 80% and enables relay-assisted multiuser MIMO to be implemented in practice. This approach is a new distributed participatory downlink transmission method, where both the relays and destinations participate in the scheduling decisions. A new recursive algorithm is also developed to optimally quantize the channel conditions of the vehicles, thereby minimizing the feedback requirement. Analytical results, confirmed by simulations, show that the proposed approach is able to achieve 97.6% of the sum-rate upper bound of the network, using only three bits to characterize the channel condition of each vehicle. In terms of throughput, the proposed decentralized scheme can perform 45.2% better than the existing centralized scheme. The proposed approach is compatible with industrial communication standards and can be implemented with commercial industrial communication systems.},

We propose a high-precision wireless ranging and misalignment estimation scheme, where high precision is achieved by iteratively measuring, estimating, and aligning the coils. Another key aspect is to convert the nonconvex misalignment estimation to a more tractable problem with a convex objective. We develop a conditional gradient descent method to solve the problem, which performs gradient descent (or conditional gradient descent on the boundary of the search space) and projects out-of-boundary points back into the space. Employing experimentally validated models, we show that our scheme can achieve 92% of the efficiency of perfectly aligned coils in 90% of operations, and tolerate correlated distance measurement errors. In contrast, the prior art is susceptible to correlation, undergoing a significant efficiency degradation of 18.5%.},

R3E is designed to enhance existing reactive routing protocols to provide reliable and energy-efficient packet delivery against the unreliable wireless links by utilizing the local path diversity. Specifically, we introduce a biased backoff scheme during the route-discovery phase to find a robust guide path, which can provide more cooperative forwarding opportunities. Along this guide path, data packets are greedily progressed toward the destination through nodes' cooperation without utilizing the location information. Through extensive simulations, we demonstrate that compared to other protocols, R3E remarkably improves the packet delivery ratio, while maintaining high energy efficiency and low delivery latency.},

Even though the operator may not understand the attack, since the overall system appears to remain in a steady state, the consequences may be of catastrophic nature with a huge negative impact. Here, we apply a computational intelligent technique which incorporates the merits of two of the heterogeneous modeling approaches (linear time-invariant and neural networks), while considering both temporal and functional dependencies existing among the elements of an infrastructure. The experimental platform includes a power grid simulator of the IEEE 30 bus model and a cyber network emulator. Subsequently, we implemented a wide range of integrity attacks (replay, ramp, pulse, scaling, and random) with different intensity levels. A thorough evaluation procedure is carried out while the results demonstrate the ability of the proposed method to produce a desired result in terms of false positive rate, false negative rate, and detection delay.},

The framework does two essential tasks: 1) routing power from surplus locations to deficit locations by effectively coordinating with distributed energy resources (DERs); and 2) enabling customers' participation in electricity enterprise through demand response (DR). The low preference loads of the end-users are grouped into two categories, viz. shiftable and curtailable loads, according to the level of flexibility involved in their operation. Also, three smart DR options are identified to allow the customers to choose as per their requirement. The customer's participation is encouraged through a priority-based incentive mechanism. The proposed incentive mechanism uses frequency of participation of customers in DR and their contribution to benefit gained by the overall system to cater the incentives. The feasibility of the framework is demonstrated by applying on a case study network with two grid-tied microgrids simulated using Java Agent DEvelopment framework (JADE). The extensive simulation studies on the test network have proved the applicability and effectiveness of the proposed agent-based framework in mitigating the supply-demand gap in multimicrogrid environment.},

With usability, we refer to the aspects' effectiveness, efficiency, and user acceptance as defined by ISO 9241-11. The modAT4rMS notations are based on selected features from the unified modeling language (UML) and the systems modeling language (SysML), and iteratively further developed by a series of empirical studies with industrial practitioners, as well as mechatronics trainees. With modAT4rMS, an MDE approach for programmable logic controller (PLC) programming was developed with the goal to facilitate modular object-oriented programming of PLC software by improving the representation of the relationships between the structure and behavior diagram types, and by reducing the level of abstraction in the structure model. modAT4rMS notations for PLC software structure and software behavior modeling are presented and illustrated with a modeling example using a modAT4rMS editor prototype. For the evaluation of the developed notations, the results from a study with 168 participants are presented, showing the benefits of this new approach in comparison with the classic procedural paradigm (IEC 61131-3) and the domain-specific UML profile (plcML) in regard to programming performance and usability aspects. Finally, the advantages and limitations of the approach are discussed, and an outlook for further development is given.},

The results show a clear increase in the computation speed in comparison to the standard personal computer (PC)-based implementation, demonstrating the usefulness of the intrinsic parallelism of FPGAs in the neurocomputational tasks and the suitability of the hardware version of the C-Mantec algorithm for its application to real-world problems.},

  Abstract                 = {As the result of increasing population and growing technological activities, nonrenewable energy sources, which are the main energy providers, are diminishing day by day. Due to this factor, efforts on efficient utilization of renewable energy sources have increased all over the world. Wind is one of the most significant alternative energy resources. However, in comparison with other renewable energy sources, it is so variable that there is a need for estimating and planning of wind power generation. In this paper, a new statistical short-term (up to 48 h) wind power forecast model, namely statistical hybrid wind power forecast technique (SHWIP), is presented. In the proposed model, weather events are clustered with respect to the most important weather forecast parameters. It also combines the power forecasts obtained from three different numerical weather prediction (NWP) sources and produces a hybridized final forecast. The proposed model has been in operation at the Wind Power Monitoring and Forecast System for Turkey (RITM), and the results of the new model are compared with well-known statistical models and physical models in the literature. The most important characteristics of the proposed model is the need for a lesser amount of historical data while constructing the mathematical model compared with the other statistical models such as artificial neural networks (ANN) and support vector machine (SVM). To produce a reliable forecast, ANN and SVM need at least 1 year of historical data; on the other hand, the proposed SHWIP method's results are applicable even under 1 month of training data, and this is an important feature for the forecast of the newly established wind power plants (WPPs).},

Such specification requirements demand the flexibility to manage manufacturing event correlations, performance constraints, and timing restrictions, such as holdups and delays. Moreover, this language enriches temporal logic expressiveness with random access to past values and fuzzy evolutionary semantics. Given a specific input trace, this interpretation not only aims to measure the degree of truth of an assertion, but also sets how it will evolve in the future if new trace suffixes are provided. As it is usually the case in runtime verification, the language provides for oracle generation, and so an automatic observable specification can be obtained from high-level requirements. To test the expressiveness and practical usefulness of FTL-CFree, the specifications of two industrial use cases are generated: 1) a batch plant in a glassworks; and 2) a manufacturing execution system.},

Our method combines simulation-based analysis of a detailed model of the system that contains continuous patient dynamics with model checking of a more abstract timed automata model.

  Abstract                 = {The need for accurate, fast, and reliable indoor localization using wireless sensor networks (WSNs) has recently grown in diverse areas of industry. Accurate localization in cluttered and noisy environments is commonly provided by means of a mathematical algorithm referred to as a state estimator or filter. The particle filter (PF), which is the most commonly used filter in localization, suffers from the sample impoverishment problem under typical conditions of real-time localization based on WSNs. This paper proposes a novel hybrid particle/finite impulse response (FIR) filtering algorithm for improving reliability of PF-based localization schemes under harsh conditions causing sample impoverishment. The hybrid particle/FIR filter detects the PF failures and recovers the failed PF by resetting the PF using the output of an auxiliary FIR filter. Combining the regularized particle filter (RPF) and the extended unbiased FIR (EFIR) filter, the hybrid RP/EFIR filter is constructed in this paper. Through simulations, the hybrid RP/EFIR filter demonstrates its improved reliability and ability to recover the RPF from failures.},

  Abstract                 = {Visualization and situational awareness are of vital importance for power systems, as the earlier a power-system event such as a transmission line fault or cyber-attack is identified, the quicker operators can react to avoid unnecessary loss. Accurate time-synchronized data, such as system measurements and device status, provide benefits for system state monitoring. However, the time-domain analysis of such heterogeneous data to extract patterns is difficult due to the existence of transient phenomena in the analyzed measurement waveforms. This paper proposes a sequential pattern mining approach to accurately extract patterns of power-system disturbances and cyber-attacks from heterogeneous time-synchronized data, including synchrophasor measurements, relay logs, and network event monitor logs. The term common path is introduced. A common path is a sequence of critical system states in temporal order that represent individual types of disturbances and cyber-attacks. Common paths are unique signatures for each observed event type. They can be compared to observed system states for classification. In this paper, the process of automatically discovering common paths from labeled data logs is introduced. An included case study uses the common path-mining algorithm to learn common paths from a fusion of heterogeneous synchrophasor data and system logs for three types of disturbances (in terms of faults) and three types of cyber-attacks, which are similar to or mimic faults. The case study demonstrates the algorithm's effectiveness at identifying unique paths for each type of event and the accompanying classifier's ability to accurately discern each type of event.},

Real-time flight termination operation demands a very highly reliable and ruggedized platform. Hence, the FTS is implemented in FPGA. In order to minimize hardware resources and to enable future upgradation, efficient optimization technique has been applied. LabVIEW, a high-level programming language is used to simulate and implement the system in real time and enables rapid prototyping. The system was validated at subsystems level by measurements of different parameters in various intermediate stages of processing, and further was validated as an integrated system at real-time telecommunication operation environment.},

  Abstract                 = {The installation of photovoltaic (PV) plants has been expanding rapidly across the world during the last years. In this paper, a methodology for the design optimization of PV plants is presented, which, in contrast to the conventional PV plant design approaches, is suitable to be executed using high time-resolution (i.e., 1-min-average) values of the meteorological input data. Due to the nonlinear operation of the devices comprising a PV plant, this allows for the accurate estimation of the PV plant performance during its operational lifetime period. A parallel processing-based implementation of genetic algorithms has been employed, which, compared to the serial execution, provides the ability to accomplish the proposed optimal design procedure in a considerably shorter time interval. The design optimization results confirm that the proposed method successfully accounts for both the meteorological conditions and the operational characteristics of the PV plant components and incorporates their impact on the PV plant energy production and cost in the design process. Thus, the proposed optimization method allows for optimum design of PV systems, which will provide maximum economic profit during their lifetime period.},

The problem of obtaining a maximum allowable delay bound has been widely studied in the networked control systems (NCS) area. Once the delay bound is derived, the remaining question is how to make a network satisfy the bound. In this paper, we propose a robust path selection algorithm, which exploits multipath diversity for providing robust network performance against intrinsic randomness in delay. Our path selection algorithm gives the required paths for any given robustness level parameterized by the reliability violation probability. Based on extensive experimental results with our testbed, we empirically show that the proposed scheme can provide the required network quality of service (QoS) for system robustness.},

The system consists of linear potentiometers, flexible wires, and linear springs, which makes it compact and lightweight so that it does not interfere with the natural motion of the fingers. Inspired by the way wrinkles on finger joints are smoothed out when the finger is flexed, a flexible wire is attached to the back of each finger. As the flexible wire moves due to the motion of the finger, the joint angles are calculated by measuring the change in length of wire. Linear potentiometers with linear springs were used to maintain the tension of the wires in order to measure the wire length change consistently. Because the motion of the proximal interphalangeal (PIP) joint is dependent on that of the distal interphalangeal (DIP) joint, only two linear potentiometers were used for each finger. A compact sensing module including 10 linear potentiometers and springs was attached to a glove. The proposed system can widely be applied for the systems, which require to measure finger motions accurately, e.g., virtual reality or teleoperation systems. Such feasible applications were actually implemented and introduced in this paper.},

  Abstract                 = {This work presents an event-based control structure using the generalized predictive control (GPC) algorithm with actuator deadband. The main objective of this work is to limit the number of controlled system updates. In this approach, the controlled process is sampled with a constant sampling time and is updated in an asynchronous way that depends on the obtained control signal value. To achieve the desired control properties, a hybrid system framework is used to model the virtual actuator deadband. The deadband is modeled as system input constraints in the GPC's optimization procedure, exploring mixed integer quadratic programming (MIQP) techniques. The presented control structure considers adjustable actuator deadband as an additional tuning parameter and allows a tradeoff between control performance and the number of events/updates. This fact is very important for the lifetime of the actuators and minimizes their wear, especially for mechanical and electromechanical systems. The minimization of actuator usage can be also understood as an economical saving. Other benefits can be found in distributed control systems, where various control system agents are connected through computer networks, and where a reduction in communication is always welcome.},

  Abstract                 = {Grid-connected converters employ LCL-filters, instead of simple inductors, because they allow lower inductances while reducing cost and size. Active damping, without dissipative elements, is preferred to passive damping for solving the associated stability problems. However, large variations in the grid inductance may compromise system stability, and this problem is more severe for parallel converters. This situation, typical of rural areas with solar and wind resources, calls for robust LCL-filter design. This paper proposes a design procedure with remarkable results under severe grid inductance variation. The procedure considers active damping using lead-lag network and capacitor current feedback. Passive damping is also discussed. The design flow, with little iteration and no complex algorithms, selects the proper ratios between the switching and resonance frequency, the grid and converter inductance, and the filter capacitance and total inductance. An estimation for the grid current total harmonic distortion (THD) is also proposed. Simulation and experiments validate the proposals.},

  Abstract                 = {Three-phase active rectifiers guarantee sinusoidal input currents and unity power factor at the price of a high switching frequency ripple. To adopt an LCL-filter, instead of an L-filter, allows using reduced values for the inductances and so preserving dynamics. However, stability problems can arise in the current control loop if the present resonance is not properly damped. Passive damping simply adds resistors in series with the LCL-filter capacitors. This simplicity is at the expense of increased losses and encumbrances. Active damping modifies the control algorithm to attain stability without using dissipative elements but, sometimes, needing additional sensors. This solution has been addressed in many publications. The lead-lag network method is one of the first reported procedures and continues being in use. However, neither there is a direct tuning procedure (without trial and error) nor its rationale has been explained. Thus, in this paper a straightforward procedure is developed to tune the lead-lag network with the help of software tools. The rationale of this procedure, based on the capacitor current feedback, is elucidated. Stability is studied by means of the root locus analysis in z-plane. Selecting the lead-lag network for the maximum damping in the closed-loop poles uses a simple optimization algorithm. The robustness against the grid inductance variation is also analyzed. Simulations and experiments confirm the validity of the proposed design flow.},

  Abstract                 = {This work presents a control system suitable for high-precision pulsed current sources. The proposed control system is based on the detection of events so as to define changes in the power converter state to produce the required current waveform with a good dynamic response. Additionally, this control system is designed to regulate the flat-top current with a well-defined precision. In order to mitigate the effect of the measurement noise, an estimation algorithm for the controlled current is incorporated. This algorithm generates a filtered version of the controlled variable without affecting the control dynamics. The use of the estimated current allows to improve the detection of the events and to avoid an increase in the number of commutations due to possible erratic comparisons. Then, the estimator gains are tuned by using genetic algorithm techniques to optimize the root-mean-square value for a typical pulse. Furthermore, in order to independently perform the required set of tasks, the proposed control system is implemented by using a digital platform based on a field-programmable gate array. Additionally, due to the demanding precision in these applications, different considerations regarding its implementation, such as the digital wordlength, binary point position, rounding method, and overflow behavior, have been taken into account. Experimental results obtained from the application of the proposed control system to a laboratory prototype are presented.},

We propose a novel platform designed for this purpose, which integrates a standard multiagent development framework [Java Agent Development (JADE)] and an industry standard communications network simulator (OPNET modeler). It was realized through generic extensions of the JADE framework to provide discrete event scheduling capabilities, while the OPNET modeler was extended to provide a generic method of associating the network nodes with agents running in JADE. The adopted method adheres to the high-level architecture standard. Importantly, applications developed using this platform may be deployed on the target system without manual modifications. A distributed protection application is presented and the performance is analyzed with respect to candidate agent behaviors and communication scenarios, demonstrating that the feasibility of the application critically depends on the choices made during its design and implementation.},

We propose a new extended finite impulse response (EFIR) filtering algorithm and show that it meets this need. The EFIR filter requires an optimal averaging interval, but does not involve the noise statistics which are often not well known to the engineer. It is more accurate than the extended Kalman filter (EKF) under real operation conditions and its iterative algorithm has the Kalman form. Better performance of the proposed EFIR filter is demonstrated based on extensive simulations in a comparison to EKF, which is widely used in RFID tag grids. We also show that errors in noise covariances may provoke divergence in EKF, whereas the EFIR filter remains stable and is thus more robust.},

  Abstract                 = {Currently, there is a need in all disciplines for efficient and powerful machine learning (ML) algorithms for handling offline and real-time nonlinear data. Industrial applications abound from real-time control systems to modeling and simulation of complex systems and processes. Certain ML methods have become popular with researchers and engineers. Such techniques include fuzzy systems (FSs), artificial neural networks (ANNs), radial basis function (RBF) networks, and support vector regression (SVR) machines. Historically, polynomial-based learning machines (PLMs) based on the group method of data handling (GMDH) model have enjoyed usage similar to that of these other methods. However, unwieldy kernel functions in the form of large high-order polynomials, and relatively limited computer speed and capacity, have limited the use of PLMs to comparatively small problems with low dimensionality and simple functional relationships. Thus, true polynomial-based ML solutions have drifted out of vogue for at least two decades. This work attempts to reinvigorate the interest in PLMs by introducing a novel practical implementation called PolyNet. It will be shown that once certain algorithms are applied to the generation, training, and functional operation of PLMs, they can compete on par with or better than methods currently in use.},

Networked digital surveillance devices are revolutionizing the surveillance industry by supporting high quality images, remote monitoring, and advanced image processing. However, they also raise serious privacy/security concerns. To address the issue, the surveillance industry has recently begun to provide basic support for secure communications. In this paper, we present a new protocol to significantly enhance the security and performance compared with the state-of-the-art baseline method widely taken in the video surveillance industry. Through extensive experiments for performance evaluation, our approach is shown to substantially reduce the delay to execute cryptographic mechanisms and increase the supported bit rate compared with the baseline, while providing desirable security features.},

It may need to visit some processing steps for a number of times, called wafer revisiting. For the typical wafer revisiting process of atomic layer deposition (ALD), this paper studies the scheduling problem of dual-arm cluster tools with both residency time constraints and wafer revisiting. To do so, a Petri net model is developed for the system. Then, with the Petri net model and based on a one-wafer cyclic scheduling method previously developed by the authors of this paper, schedulability conditions and scheduling algorithms are derived. The schedulability can be checked by analytical expressions. If schedulable, an optimal one-wafer cyclic schedule can be found by simple calculation. Thus, the proposed approach is very efficient. In addition, with the Petri net model, a simple way is presented to implement the obtained schedule. Illustrative examples are given to show the application of the proposed approach.},

The key structure of the proposed control technique is a combination of a limiting integral loop and related arithmetic operations to produce the desired switching sequence during transient condition. The limiting integral loop is built as a novel structure for capacitor charge balance operation. In contrast to previous approaches, the proposed control technique is valid for three basic converters: 1) buck; 2) boost; and 3) buck-boost. Moreover, since the transient period is forced to be an integer multiple of the switching cycle, the advantage of fixed switching frequency is inherently provided. Simulation and experimental results from a noninverting synchronous buck-boost converter prototype are given to validate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

To avoid overloads and maximize customer preferences in terms of time and cost of charging, a constrained nonlinear optimization problem can be formulated. In this paper, we have developed a novel cooperative distributed algorithm for charging control of PHEVs/PEVs that solves the constrained nonlinear optimization problem using Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions and consensus networks in a distributed fashion. In our design, the global optimal power allocation under all local and global constraints is reached through peer-to-peer coordination of charging stations. Therefore, the need for a central control unit is eliminated. In this way, single-node congestion is avoided when the size of the problem is increased and the system gains robustness against single-link/node failures. Furthermore, via Monte Carlo simulations, we have demonstrated that the proposed distributed method is scalable with the number of charging points and returns solutions, which are comparable to centralized optimization algorithms with a maximum of 2% sub-optimality. Thus, the main advantages of our approach are eliminating the need for a central energy management/coordination unit, gaining robustness against single-link/node failures, and being scalable in terms of single-node computations.},

  Abstract                 = {In the last decades, finite control set-model predictive control (FCS-MPC) has been extensively investigated. This control strategy uses the system model to determine the optimal input that minimizes a predefined cost function. This procedure is performed by evaluating the admissible inputs of the converter model. In order to achieve a proper performance of the control strategy, a small sampling time must be used. In practice, the computational effort and processing time are critical factors that depend directly on the number of admissible states of the topology. With the objective of reducing the execution time needed by the algorithm, it is possible to take advantage of the high degree of parallelism that can be obtained from a field-programmable gate array (FPGA). This paper deals with the implementation of FCS-MPC in an FPGA XC3S3500E to control a power cell of a cascaded half bridge (CHB) converter. The design is divided into subparts, called modules, which can be projected to control multiple cells using only one chip. In addition, with the aim to restrict the use of hardware to the available resources, the document presents a series of considerations related to the algorithm and its implementation. This paper presents a detailed guide with emphasis on the design and outlining of each module in order to reduce the developing times for researchers in the area of power converters.},

Hence, effective management of prosumers has become pivotal to ensure a long-term, sustainable energy-sharing process. Recently, the concept of a Prosumer Community Group (PCG) has emerged as one of the most promising and effective ways to manage prosumers. However, developing sustainable PCGs is challenging. One of the key challenges in this regard is to assess the contribution made by individual prosumers of a PCG, and find a subset of the most influential prosumers whose behavior would facilitate the long-term sustainability of the PCG. In this paper, we have focused on this challenge and proposed an innovative methodology to assess and rank the prosumers, in order to build an influential membership base. We have assessed the long-term and short-term energy behaviors of prosumers based on multiple evaluation criteria and accordingly decided the ranks of the prosumers, whereby the higher ranked prosumers are deemed to be more influential in enhancing the long-term sustenance of the PCG. Furthermore, we have presented simulation results to verify our proposed methodology. The current literature on smart-grid research field has no work investigating this challenge, making our contribution novel.},

  Abstract                 = {Monitoring large supply networks can be efficiently performed by employing active radio-frequency identification (a-RFID) sensors. Relay nodes collect and process workflow information from the sensors. The knowledge derived from the collected information is periodically communicated to monitors using onboard energy sources. Energy can be saved by communicating with closer monitors. In this setup, multiple decision makers with their own deployment budget collaborate to deploy monitors for minimizing energy consumption of the relay nodes. The contribution of this paper is threefold. It elaborates a mathematical model for distributed monitor deployment in budget-constrained supply-chain networks, it proposes a heuristic technique to find near-optimal allocation of monitors in tractable manner, and it illustrates a collaborative procedure to jointly minimize energy consumption along with a fair sharing of total deployment cost among multiple decision makers. The approach is presented through a case study. In addition, benchmark results are provided for a number of problem instances.},

This optimization framework offers a number of very convenient features: distribution of the overall network control effort among the local agents; no overall network knowledge required; the introduction/elimination of a node only affects to its neighbors. Thus, this integrated framework offers a powerful and easy-to-use mathematical tool in order to analyze and manage a wide variety of today's large-scale network.

This model is represented by two electrical circuits, of which one reproduces the fuel cell's output voltage characteristic and the other its thermal characteristic. The output voltage model includes activation, concentration, and ohmic losses, which describe the static properties, while the double-layer charging effect, which delays in fuel and oxygen supplies, and other effects provide the model's dynamic properties. In addition, a novel thermal model of the studied Ballard's 1.2-kW Nexa fuel cell is proposed. The latter includes the thermal effects of the stack's fan, which significantly improve the model's accuracy. The parameters of both, the electrical and the thermal, equivalent circuits were estimated on the basis of experimental data using an evolution strategy. The resulting parameters were validated by the measurement data obtained from the Nexa module. The comparison indicates a good agreement between the simulation and the experiment. In addition to simulations, the identified model is also suitable for usage in real-time fuel cell emulators. The emulator presented in this paper additionally proves the accuracy of the obtained model and the effectiveness of using an evolution strategy for identification of the fuel cell's parameters.},

  Abstract                 = {Recently, the International Society of Automation (ISA) released ISA100.11a as an open standard for reliable wireless networks for industrial automation. ISA100.11a operates in the 2.4-GHz industrial, scientific, and medical (ISM) unlicensed band, and may suffer from interference from other radio technologies operating in the same band. This coexistence issue can lead to significant degradation of ISA100.11a performance. In this work, the performance of the ISA100.11a industrial wireless network under interference from an IEEE 802.11b wireless local area network (WLAN) is evaluated. An analytical model for the coexistence between ISA100.11a and IEEE 802.11b is suggested. The packet error rate (PER) and average end-to-end delay are evaluated, where the PER is obtained from the bit error probability and collision time, whereas the average end-to-end delay is investigated from the waiting time in buffer and the transmission time. Simulation results from the OPNET modeler are presented to validate the numerical analysis. It is demonstrated that ISA100.11a achieves acceptable PER and satisfies the delay requirement for industrial process control and monitoring, even under significant WLAN interference.},

This paper reviews recent advancements in FPGA technology, emphasizing the novel features that may significantly contribute to the development of more efficient digital systems for industrial applications. Special attention is paid to the design paradigm shift caused by the availability of increasingly powerful embedded (and soft) processors, which transformed FPGAs from hardware accelerators to very powerful system-on-chip (SoC) platforms. New analog resources, floating-point operators, and hard memory controllers are also described, because of the great advantages they provide to designers. Software tools are being strongly influenced by the design paradigm shift, which requires from them a much better support for software developers. Focusing mainly on this issue, recent advancements in software resources [intellectual property (IP) cores and design tools] are also reviewed. The impact of new FPGA features in industrial applications is analyzed in detail in three main areas, namely digital real-time simulation, advanced control techniques, and electronic instrumentation, with focus on mechatronics, robotics, and power systems design. The way digital systems are being currently designed in these areas is comprehensively reviewed, and a critical analysis of how they could significantly benefit from new FPGA features is presented.},

  Abstract                 = {The ability to perform accurate localization is a fundamental requirement of the navigation systems intended to guide unmanned ground vehicles in a given environment. Currently, the use of vision-based systems is a very suitable alternative for some indoor applications. This paper presents a novel distributed FPGA-based embedded image processing system for accurate and fast simultaneous estimation of the position and orientation of remotely controlled vehicles in indoor spaces. It is based on a network of distributed image processing nodes, which minimize the amount of data to be transmitted through communication networks and hence allow dynamic response to be improved, providing a simple, flexible, low-cost, and very efficient solution. The proposed system works properly under variable or nonhomogeneous illumination conditions, which simplifies the deployment. Experimental results on a real scenario are presented and discussed. They demonstrate that the system clearly outperforms the existing solutions of similar complexity. Only much more complex and expensive systems achieve similar performance.},

  Abstract                 = {Demand response enabled by time-varying prices can propel the power industry toward a greater efficiency. However, a noncoordinated response of customers may lead to severe peak rebounds at periods with lower prices. In this regard, a coordinated demand response scheme can mitigate concerns about the peak rebounds. This paper presents a system-wide demand response management model to coordinate demand response provided by residential customers. The objective of the model is to flatten the total load profile that is subject to minimum individual cost of customers. The model is first formulated as a bi-level optimization problem. It is then casted into equivalent single-level problems, which are solved via an iterative distributed algorithm. Home load management (HLM) modules embedded in customers' smart meters are autonomous agents associated with the algorithm. In the algorithm, at first, HLM modules, in response to prices announced by the utility, optimize the daily operation of household appliances and send back the scheduled load profiles. Then, the total load profile is calculated and released by the utility. Thereafter, the HLM modules asynchronously update their schedule such that, given their least energy expenses, the most evenly distributed total load profile is achieved. The mutual interaction between the utility and HLM modules is continued to the point in which no further improvement is obtained. Convergence and optimality of the algorithm are proved.},

In the detection and prediction of incipient faults in power transformers using dissolved gas analysis (DGA), the problem of missing values is significant and has resulted in inconclusive decision-making. This study proposes an efficient nonparametric iterative imputation method named FINNIM, which comprises of three components: 1) the imputation ordering; 2) the imputation estimator; and 3) the iterative imputation. The relationship between gases and faults, and the percentage of missing values in an instance are used as a basis for the imputation ordering; whereas the plausible values for the missing values are estimated from k-nearest neighbor instances in the imputation estimator, and the iterative imputation allows complete and incomplete instances in a DGA dataset to be utilized iteratively for imputing all the missing values. Experimental results on both artificially inserted and actual missing values found in a few DGA datasets demonstrate that the proposed method outperforms the existing methods in imputation accuracy, classification performance, and convergence criteria at different missing percentages.},

This paper proposes a new communication-based dual time-current-voltage (Dual-TCV) tripping characteristic for directional overcurrent relays (DOCRs) that considers the FRT capability of wind parks by taking fast fault isolation actions in transmission systems. The protection coordination problem is formulated and solved to determine the optimal relay tripping settings. The proposed approach is tested on the IEEE 24-bus transmission system with up to eight DFIG-based wind parks. The outcome of this study reveals that protection schemes based on DOCRs governed by the proposed Dual-TCV tripping characteristic ensures fast fault isolations that significantly enhances the FRT operation of wind parks in adherence to grid code requirements. The transient analysis verifies the superior performance of the proposed protection approach in enhancing the FRT operation of wind parks.},

  Abstract                 = {The usage of the controller area network (CAN) as an in-vehicle communication bus requires finding feasible and robust priority orders such that each message transmitted on the bus meets its specified deadline and tolerates potential transmission errors. Although such priority orders can be determined by available algorithms whenever they exist, it is always assumed that a CAN priority order is computed from scratch. In practical applications, it is frequently necessary to extend an existing message set by new messages. In this case, a feasible priority order that retains the standardized IDs of the existing messages and assigns suitable priorities to the new messages needs to be found. This paper proposes an algorithm for the computation of robust priority orders that solves the stated problem of extending existing message sets. First, bounds for the priorities of new messages are determined and then the most robust priority order that keeps the IDs of the existing messages is computed. The obtained algorithms are proved to yield correct results and are illustrated by detailed scheduling examples.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a digitally controlled photovoltaic (PV) micro-converter for dc distribution with sensing no current is presented. Current information for maximum power point tracking (MPPT) is estimated from system parameters, which leads to reducing power losses caused in sensing current and the number of components. Operation analysis of boundary conduction, quasiresonant, and discontinuous conduction modes is presented for its implementation. The high current estimation accuracy not only allows adaptive operation mode changes for efficiency optimization, but also guarantees achievement of high MPPT efficiency. Loss analysis of each operation mode is also presented to determine optimal transition points for mode change. A prototype PV micro-converter for a 120-W PV module is implemented by utilizing a digital signal processor. Experimental results verify that the proposed method is stable in both static and dynamic operations. European efficiency and MPPT efficiency are measured higher than 97.5% and 99.5%, respectively.},

  Abstract                 = {A vibration analysis based interturn fault diagnosis of induction machines is proposed in this paper, using a neural-network-based scheme, constituting of two parts. The first part finds out the optimum network size of the probabilistic neural network (PNN) using the Orthogonal Least Squares Regression algorithm. This judges the size of the PNN, with an effort to reduce the computation. The feature extraction to model the PNN is made meaningful using dual tree complex wavelet transform (DTCWT), which is nearly shift invariant analytical wavelet transform, giving a true representation of the input space. In the second part, preprocessing using principal component analysis is suggested as an effective way to further reduce the dimension of the feature set and size of the PNN without compromising the performance. The sensitivity, specificity, and accuracy show that the vibration signatures capture the fault more effectively (especially by the axial and radial ones), under varying supply-frequency and load conditions. A comparison with traditional discrete wavelet transform proves the applicability of the proposed scheme. A comparative evaluation with feedforward neural network and naiÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂve Bayes scheme brings out the advantage of the proposed optimized DTCWT-PNN based technique over other machine learning approaches.},

However, using variable efficiency model adds complexity to the conventional methods while increasing the computation-demand of these techniques, but this target can be simply implemented by the proposed scheme.

  Abstract                 = {Radio frequency identification (RFID) technology provides a promising solution to the problem of missing object identification in large-scale systems, such as warehouses and bookstores by employing RFID readers to communicate with numerous RFID tags, each of which is attached to a monitored object. To achieve prompt identification of missing tags/objects, extensive research is carried out while the transmission of expatiatory bits from each tag and the occurrence of substantial tag collisions critically degrade the time efficiency. Therefore, this motivates us to propose ProTaR, a probabilistic tag retardation-based protocol, which addresses the missing tag identification problem in a more time-efficient way than the prior work. Based on an improvement of conventional frame-slotted ALOHA algorithm, ProTaR aims at alleviating the tag collision problem and achieving compact tag transmissions. The novelty of ProTaR is manifested mainly in two aspects. ProTaR leverages a mask at a reader to distill partial bits from 96-bit identifier (ID) of each tag for the characterization of tag uniqueness. In this context, ProTaR averts the transmission of redundant bits from both the tags and reader. A bit vector is constructed by the reader to inform each tag of the transmissions of others. This idea successfully eliminates the tag collisions, and hence makes full utilization of tag responses. Experimental results validate that ProTaR achieves 100% identification accuracy regardless of missing tag ratio. Furthermore, extensive simulations present that ProTaR enables the time efficiency improvement of up to 88% compared with benchmarks while merely degrading the optimum by 15%.},

  Abstract                 = {Electric vehicle (EV) batteries tend to have accelerated degradation due to high peak power and harsh charging/ discharging cycles during acceleration and deceleration periods, particularly in Urban driving conditions. Oversized energy storage system (ESS) meets the high power demand; however, in tradeoff with increased ESS size, volume, and cost. In order to reduce overall ESS size and extend battery cycle life, battery/ultracapacitor (UC) hybrid ESS (HESS) has been considered as a solution in which UCs act as a power buffer to charging/discharging peak power. In this paper, a multiobjective optimization problem is formulated to minimize the overall ESS size, while maximizing the battery cycle life according to the assigned penalty functions. An integrated framework for HESS sizing and battery cycle life optimization applied in a midsize EV, using an Autonomie simulation model, is described and illustrated in this paper. This multidimensional optimization is realized by a sample-based global search oriented DIviding RECTangles (DIRECT) algorithm. The optimization results under Urban Dynamometer Driving Schedule (UDDS) are compared with the battery-only ESS results, which demonstrate significant battery cycle life extension of 76% achieved by the optimized HESS with 72 UC cells.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes PriorityMAC, a priority-enhanced medium access control protocol, designed for critical traffic in industrial wireless sensor and actuator networks (IWSAN). A notable trend in industrial automation in recent years has been the replacement of wired communication by IWSANs. Exceeding the required delay bound for unpredictable and emergency traffic could lead to system instability, economic and material losses, system failure, and, ultimately, a threat to human safety. Guaranteeing the timely delivery of the IWSAN critical traffic and its prioritization over regular traffic (e.g., noncritical monitoring traffic) is a significant challenge. Therefore, we present the design, implementation, performance analysis, and evaluation of PriorityMAC. A series of novel mechanisms (e.g., high priority indication space) are proposed to enable high-priority traffic to hijack the transmission bandwidth of the low-priority traffic. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first priority-enhanced MAC protocol compatible with industrial standards for IWSAN. PriorityMAC is implemented in TinyOS and evaluated on a testbed of Telosb motes. The experimental results indicate that PriorityMAC efficiently handles different traffic categories with different latency requirements, thereby achieving a significant improvement in the delivery latency compared with the current industrial standards.},

  Abstract                 = {Existing work on flooding in wireless sensor networks (WSNs) mainly focuses on single-packet problem, while the work on sequential multipacket problem is surprisingly little. This paper proposes OppCode, a new opportunistic network-coding-based flooding architecture for multipacket dissemination in WSNs, where both unreliable and correlated links commonly exist. Instead of flooding a single packet each time, each node encodes multiple native packets chosen from a specific fixed-size page to an encoded packet and then rebroadcasts it further. The key idea consists of two parts. One is opportunistically coding decision, in which each node grasps every possible coding opportunity greedily to maximize its aggregate coding gain of all neighbors based on the probabilistic estimation of packets each neighbor already has. The other is paged collective acknowledgements (ACKs), in which one rebroadcast acts as not only an implicit ACK of successful disseminations of all packets in the entire page for the sender, but also probabilistic ACK to update page-scale per-packet coverage estimations for its neighbors in a batch. Experiments based on extensive simulations and 21-node testbed show that OppCode significantly increases performance of multipacket flooding in terms of reliability, transmission overhead, delay, and load balance.},

Prediction intervals (PIs) are statistical tools which quantify the uncertainty related to forecasts by estimating the ranges of the future electricity prices. Traditional approaches based on neural networks (NNs) generate PIs at the cost of high computational burden and doubtful assumptions about data distributions. In this work, we propose a novel technique that is not plagued with the above limitations and it generates high-quality PIs in a short time. The proposed method directly generates the lower and upper bounds of the future electricity prices using support vector machines (SVM). Optimal model parameters are obtained by the minimization of a modified PI-based objective function using a particle swarm optimization (PSO) technique. The efficiency of the proposed method is illustrated using data from Ontario, Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) interconnection day-ahead and real-time markets.},

  Abstract                 = {The paper deals with the application of two empirical mode decomposition (EMD)-based de-noising techniques in power quality assessment. Distinct threshold parameters at a distinct level of decomposition are employed for noise exclusion. Each of the thresholded intrinsic mode functions (IMFs) are then combined together to yield a de-noised version of the signal. For enhanced performance, various noisy versions from the original signal are created and then de-noised using soft thresholds. The resultant de-noised signals are then averaged to obtain the de-noised version of the signal. In other procedures based on EMD, the signal is chopped into smaller portions each having equal length. Each signal portion is then separately subjected to EMD and then de-noised and later combined to obtain noise-free signal. These de-noised signals are then subjected to Hilbert transform for feature extraction. Fuzzy Product Aggregation Reasoning Rule-based intelligent classifier is used here for classification purpose. A comparative study is also made between S-transform-based and wavelet-transform-based de-noising techniques paper. Real-time implementation of the algorithm on a noisy harmonic signal is also given in this paper.},

An innovative method that allows regulators assessing the impact of incentives related to investments in innovation in an electrical distribution network is presented in this paper. The method is flexible enough to allow different stakeholders like regulators, distribution companies, and developers to evaluate the long-term economic effects of their decisions. The effectiveness of the proposed method, based on nondominated sorting genetic algorithm and on multi-period optimal power flow, is verified on a 69-bus network.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless underground sensor networks (WUSNs) are a category of wireless sensor networks (WSNs) with buried nodes, which communicate wirelessly through soil with sensor nodes located aboveground. As the communication medium (i.e., soil) between traditional over-the-air WSNs and WUSNs differs, communication characteristics have to be fully characterized for WUSNs, specifically to enable development of efficient communication protocols. Characterization of link quality is a fundamental building block for various communication protocols. The aim of this paper is to experimentally investigate the link quality characteristics of the three communication channels available in WUSNs for underground pipeline monitoring to gain further insight into protocol development for WUSNs. To this end, received signal strength (RSS), link quality indicator (LQI), and packet reception ratio (PRR) are characterized for the three communication channels in WUSNs. The RSS and PRR results show that the underground-to-underground channel is highly symmetric and temporally stable, but its range is severely limited, and that the aboveground-to-underground/underground-to-underground channels are asymmetric and exhibit similar temporal properties to over-the-air communication channels. Interestingly, the results show that RSS is a better indicator of PRR than LQI for all three channels under consideration.},

  Abstract                 = {In this paper, a generalized double-shell framework for the optimal design of systems managed optimally according to different criteria is developed. Optimal design is traditionally carried out by means of minimum capital and management cost formulations and does not typically consider optimized operation. In this paper, the optimized multiobjective management is explicitly considered into the design formulation. The quality of each design solution is indeed defined by the evaluation of operational costs and capital costs. Besides, the assessment of the operational costs term is deduced by means of the solution of a multiobjective optimization problem. Each design solution is evaluated using the outcomes of a multiobjective optimization run: a Pareto hyper-surface in the n-dimensional space of the operational objectives. In the literature, commonly the evaluation of each design solution is carried out based on an approximate evaluation of the operational costs, not considering the real multiobjective optimized management. In this paper, such assessment is carried out using a suitable convergence indicator typically used for multiobjective optimization algorithms. The application is devoted to the problem of optimal sizing of distributed energy resources in medium voltage or low voltage microgrids. For this problem, the identification of the multiple operational impacts comes along with the solution of the optimal unit commitment of distributed generators. After the introductory section, the problem formulation is presented and an interesting application of the considered approach to the design of distributed energy sources in a microgrid is shown.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper deals with the voltage control and load leveling of permanent magnet synchronous generator (PMSG)-based diesel generator (DG) set for standalone supply system. The proposed system is composed of a PMSG and a prototype of diesel engine (DE), along with the distribution static compensator (DSTATCOM) and battery energy storage system (BESS). The DSTATCOM along with BESS is used for loads leveling and voltage control. It also provides balancing of loads, elimination of harmonics, and compensation of reactive power. The battery on dc link of voltage source converter (VSC) of DSTATCOM is used to supply the active power when the load is more than PMSG rating, and it stores the energy during light load periods. The PMSG is always loaded with an optimum load of 80%-100% of its rating. An optimum loading of DG set helps in improving the fuel efficiency of the DE and also helps in load leveling. The reference source currents are estimated using a hyperbolic tangent function-based least mean square (LMS) algorithm. This control algorithm has reduced computation and provides fast convergence rate to eliminate the effect of noise as compared with other LMS algorithms based on adaptive filtering. The voltage control, load compensation, and fuel efficiency improvement in PMSG-based DG set using BESS and DSTATCOM controlled by hyperbolic tangent function-based LMS algorithm are the main contributions of this paper.},

The switching strategy and control mechanism for the converter is presented using time domain simulations in MATLAB environment. A specific triggering pattern has been generated for the switching devices in the converter to achieve desired polarity of the output voltage across the distributed load. The harmonics in the input supply side of the converter are mitigated by using delta modulation technique, whereas in the output of the converter, passive filtering has been used along with delta modulation technique. The design and implementation issues of the modulation technique and the switching scheme are discussed in detail with suitable simulation and experimental results. The analysis and properties of the proposed solution is compared with the known solutions. It has been concluded that an ac-ac converter is technically a viable option to interface a wind turbine to a utility grid.},

One aspect that is lacking, however, is the ability to directly express Statecharts-like hierarchy and concurrency within basic function blocks (BFBs). Such features can significantly enhance function blocks and help create more succinct and readable specifications. We propose a new syntactic extension to the standard called hierarchical and concurrent execution control chart (HCECC). A major roadblock for any suggested changes to the standard is the need for compliance. Our approach extends the synchronous execution semantics of IEC 61499, where HCECCs are purely syntactic sugar. Using a revised synchronous semantics, our compiler generates standard compliant C code from HCECCs. Benchmarking and usability studies reveal the relative superiority of the proposed approach over existing approaches.},

A thermo compensation algorithm is capable of avoiding the effect of the environmental temperature on the measurements by keeping stable zero-offset within ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ±1 mV and ensuring low absolute error within 0.1% vol. The thorough design of the sensor node allows it to fit into the 5.5 cm3 packaging, which ensures its true ubiquitous deployment in outdoor and industrial environment.},

  Abstract                 = {Under fast-varying solar irradiation and load resistance, a fast-converging maximum power point tracking (MPPT) system is required to ensure the photovoltaic (PV) system response rapidly with minimum power losses. Traditionally, maximum power point (MPP) locus was used to provide such a fast response. However, the algorithm requires extra control loop or intermittent disconnection of the PV module. Hence, this paper proposes a simpler fast-converging MPPT technique, which excludes the extra control loop and intermittent disconnection. In the proposed algorithm, the relationship between the load line and the I-V curve is used with trigonometry rule to obtain the fast response. Results of the simulation and experiment using single-ended primary-inductor converter showed that the response of the proposed algorithm is four times faster than the conventional incremental conductance algorithm during the load and solar irradiation variation. Consequently, the proposed algorithm has higher efficiency.},

  Abstract                 = {Industrial low-power wireless mesh networks are shifting towards time-synchronized medium access control (MAC) protocols which are able to yield over 99.9% end-to-end reliability and radio duty cycles well below 1%. In these networks, motes use time slots to communicate, and neighbor motes maintain their clocks' alignment, typically within 1 ms. Temperature, supply voltage, and fabrication differences cause the motes' clocks to drift with respect to one another. Neighbor motes need to re-synchronize periodically through pairwise communication. This period is typically determined a priori, based on the worst case drift. In this paper, we propose a novel technique which measures and models the relative clock drift between neighbor motes, thereby reducing the effective drift rate. Instead of resynchronizing at a preset rate, neighbor motes resynchronize only when needed. This reduces the minimum achievable duty cycle of an idle network by a factor of 10, which in turn lowers the mote power consumption and extends the network lifetime. This Adaptive Synchronization is implemented as part of IEEE802.15.4e in the OpenWSN protocol stack and is validated through extensive experimentation.},

Many nonlinear characteristics of a power generator, such as the ramp rate limits, prohibited operating zones and nonsmooth cost functions are considered when the proposed method is used in practice for optimizing the generators' operation. The performance of the RDPSO method is evaluated on three different power systems, and compared with that of other optimization methods in terms of the solution quality, robustness, and convergence performance.

  Abstract                 = {Cooperative relaying communications is an efficient paradigm for end-to-end data delivery in industrial wireless sensor networks. However, due to the broadcast nature of radio propagation, it is challenging to guarantee the secrecy of cooperative transmissions under eavesdropping attacks. To deal with this issue, a fountain-coding aided relaying scheme is proposed in this paper, for which all the source packets are first encoded with fountain codes (FCs) and then transmitted over the channels. Based on the basic characteristic of FC transmissions, a sufficient number of coded packets have to be successfully received to recover the original data. Therefore, transmission secrecy is guaranteed if the legitimate receiver can accumulate the required number of FC packets before the eavesdropper does. To satisfy this condition, a cooperative jamming method is utilized to worsen the received signal quality at the eavesdropper. By applying the constellation rotation approach, the information-bearing signal and the jamming signal are designed carefully to reduce the negative effect of the jamming procedure on the legitimate receiver. To evaluate how the scheme behaves in wireless fading channels, the authors propose a novel performance metric, i.e., the quality-of-service violating probability (QVP), and derive its closed-form expression. Compared to the commonly used metrics in physical-layer security such as secrecy outage probability, QVP can give a more comprehensive performance evaluation for the system, including the delay, the reliability, and the security level as well. Finally, the theoretical analysis is validated by simulation results.},

However, under partially shaded conditions (PSCs), P&O method miserably fails to recognize global MPP (GMPP) and gets trapped in one of the local MPPs (LMPPs). This paper proposes ant-colony-based search in the initial stages of tracking followed by P&O method. In such a hybrid approach, the global search ability of ant-colony optimization (ACO) and local search capability of P&O method are integrated to yield faster and efficient convergence. A theoretical analysis of the static and dynamic convergence behavior of the proposed algorithm is presented together with computed and measured results.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper proposes a method for selecting photoplethysmogram features for estimating systolic blood pressure (SBP), which uses the signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) obtained from the Taguchi method. Cuffless estimation of blood pressure using just one photoplethysmograph was carried out based on the photoplethysmogram features. However, these features are highly vulnerable to noise generated by sources such as individual variability, resulting from factors such as age and gender. Therefore, features need to be robust against such noise for accurate estimation of blood pressure. In this study, we used an orthogonal array and the SNR from the Taguchi method for selecting features of multiple regression analysis that are robust against noise. We estimated SBP from two datasets by applying the proposed feature selection method to multiple regression analysis. The obtained results show that the correlation coefficients between the actual measurement values and the estimated values were 0.88 and 0.87 for datasets 1 and 2, which are higher than those of similar methods used for comparison purposes. This confirms the effectiveness of the proposed method in estimating SBP.},

  Abstract                 = {Inductive power transfer (IPT) systems are increasingly being used in numerous industrial applications, which essentially require power without any physical contacts. In contrast to unidirectional IPT systems, bidirectional IPT systems are inherently higher-order resonant networks and relatively complex in modeling, design, and control. The complexity further exacerbates with the increase in number of pickups or loads, making design and implementation of such systems a real challenge. This paper, therefore, develops a multivariable dynamic model for a multipickup bidirectional IPT system, which can provide an accurate insight into the behavior of this system and can be used for controller synthesis under variations of component values. The output sensitivity to various parameters and the interaction among various control variables and degree of controllability of the system are investigated using frequency domain analysis. The validity of the model is verified under various operating conditions by comparing the predicted behavior with a 1-kW prototype of a bidirectional IPT system with two pickups. Measured results convincingly demonstrate that the proposed model accurately predicts the dynamic behavior of bidirectional IPT systems with multiple pickups and can, therefore, be used as a valuable tool for both dynamic analysis and controller design.},

  Abstract                 = {Data communication in mobile ad hoc cognitive networks (MACNets) significantly suffers from link instability and channel interference. The availability and stability of each link in MACNets highly depends on not only the relative movement of neighbor nodes but also the adjacent communication among primary nodes and among cognitive nodes. In multihop and multiflow MACNets, this problem becomes even worse because multiple links potentially interfere with each other. In this paper, we propose a cross-layer distributed approach, called mobility-prediction-based joint stable routing and channel assignment (MP-JSRCA), to maximize the network throughput by jointly selecting stable routes and assigning channels avoiding inter- and intra-flow interferences based on mobility prediction. To quantitatively measure the communication quality of links, we propose a new metric data transmission cost (DTC) that captures node mobility, impact to primary nodes, and channel conflict among cognitive nodes. In our MP-JSRCA, each relay node selects the best link with the smallest DTC as the next hop, within a specified sector region towards the destination. NS2-based simulation results demonstrate that our MP-JSRCA algorithm significantly improves network throughput, and the higher degree of interference MACNets experience, the more improvement can be achieved.},

  Abstract                 = {With the rapid development of the intelligent sensing and the prompt growing industrial safety demands, human behavior recognition has received a great deal of attentions in industrial informatics. To deploy an utmost scalable, flexible, and robust human behavior recognition system, we need both innovative sensing electronics and suitable intelligence algorithms. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) open a novel way for human behavior recognition, because the heavy computation can be immediately transferred to a network server. In this paper, a new scheme for human behavior recognition on WSNs is proposed, which transmits activities' signals compressed by Hamming compressed sensing to the network server and conducts behavior recognition through a collaboration between a new dimension reduction algorithm termed rank preserving discriminant analysis (RPDA) and a nearest neighbor classifier. RPDA encodes local rank information of within-class samples and discriminative information of the between-class under the framework of Patch Alignment Framework. Experiments are conducted on the SCUT Naturalistic 3D Acceleration-based Activity (SCUT NAA) dataset and demonstrate the effectiveness of RPDA for human behavior recognition.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy-saving and emission-reduction (ESER), carbon footprint, carbon labeling, and carbon trading have attracted much attention recently due to severe environmental challenges. One key technology for implementing the above concepts is how to realize the effective quantitative evaluation of ESER. In this paper, the existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are summarized first. It is found that the existing ESER evaluation technology and systems are almost isolated from the existing enterprise information systems, such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), product data management (PDM), and customer relationship management (CRM), which results in the expanding of the enterprise information islands. In order to address this problem, a new method for ESER life cycle assessment (LCA) based on Internet of Things (IoT) and bill of material (BOM) is proposed in this paper. A four-layered structure (i.e., perception access layer, data layer, service layer, and application layer) ESER LCA system based on IoT and BOM is designed and presented, as well as the key technologies and the functions in each layer. A prototype application system is developed to validate the proposed method. The main contributions of the proposed method are: 1) facilitate real-time intelligent perception, and the collection of energy consumption and environmental impact data generated in the entire life cycle of manufacturing by using IoT technologies; and 2) realize effective data integration between the ESER evaluation system and the existing enterprise information systems based on BOM.},

All shareholders can communicate with the developed WPMFC in order to retrieve preprocessed wind-electric power forecast data and power quality data, through the IP network according to their authorization level. The electrical and meteorological raw data can also be retrieved for postprocessing. The developed system is based on global positioning system (GPS) synchronized, real-time field measurements taken from each WPP, in addition to the use of mesoscale numerical weather prediction models. Instantaneous electrical and meteorological quantities of each WPP can be monitored continuously through the WPMFC. The forecast system employs physical, statistical, and hybrid models combining both approaches.

A new design concept of tension control in take-up system and winding pitch control through autotraverse control was developed for unmanned operation. The outcome was optimum line speed and the power consumption linearly varying with increase in line speed, which is the core advantage of using synchronized line speed via VFD. There is no hidden energy loss in the system and the inertia of the whole driven system is also reduced. In case of high-voltage cable, the life expectancy depends upon the uniform pattern of lay length with compactness, and it is a significant achievement in terms of improvement in the product quality. The novelty of this work is the simultaneous implementation of various features in a single working setup. Conventional design of very long shaft attached with huge gearboxes is replaced with a virtual electronic shaft synchronizing seven VFDs attached to a very heavy inertial load. When considering the project size, there should be replacement of the high-maintenance-prone switchgears with AEF and LCL filters coupled with common dc bus; this helps in reducing the overall project cost. Self-controlled clean and quality power [below 3% of total harmonic distortion (THD)] feeding to utility network was achieved. Energy saving with improved power factor and higher efficiency is a significant achievement from this setup. Configurable automation software using the programmable logic control (PLC) and human machine interface (HMI) for flexible production was used as per market requirements (especially for 132-kV conductor sector). The scope of this paper is limited to the overview of implementing the automation scheme, energy savings, harmonics control, and other process control re- ated to plants. The uniqueness of this experimental research project is generation and analysis of basic primary data (from September 2012 to current) and the publication available for this data. All activities from concepts to commissioning were systematically implemented and proved to be techno-economically viable.},

Moreover, these energy sources allow the energy recovery during regenerative braking. The different sources are connected to a dc bus through dc-dc converters which adapt their variable voltages to the bus voltage and allow the control of energy flow between the sources and the load. The components of the hybrid tramway have been modeled in Matlab/Simulink and are based on commercially available devices.

  Abstract                 = {The IEEE 802.3az amendment to the Ethernet standard, referred to as energy-efficient Ethernet (EEE), encompasses the new low power Idle operational mode that allows to strongly decrease the energy consumption of inactive links. The introduction of EEE in real-time industrial communications represents an interesting topic currently addressed by the scientific community, as well as by some standardization bodies. The outcomes of these activities are promising, since effective EEE strategies can be devised, and are able to cope with the very tight timing requirements of industrial communication. Unfortunately, the proposed analyses do not address implementation issues that, conversely, represent a crucial aspect in this scenario. Hence, in this paper, we specifically focus on practical issues concerned with the adoption of EEE strategies by real-time Ethernet (RTE) networks. At first, we address the use of commercially available network components and describe a measurement setup that can be adopted to achieve the adequate characterization of such components. Furthermore, we show that, in an RTE perspective, link activations/deactivations should be independently managed by suitably designed EEE strategies at the application level. Consequently, we defined a set of network services that have to be made available in the device drivers. Hence, we consider a generic RTE network and discuss methods for the practical implementation of those EEE strategies. A performance assessment carried out via theoretical models as well as numerical simulations shows that EEE strategies can be effectively implemented with considerable power savings at the expense of only minimal performance degradation.},

Further, a novel nonuniform weight-vector distribution (NUWD) strategy is proposed and an ensemble algorithm based on combination of MOEA/D with uniform weight-vector distribution (UWD) and NUWD strategy is implemented to enhance the performance of the presented algorithm. Extensive case studies are presented on different test systems and the effectiveness of the hybrid strategy, the NUWD strategy, and the ensemble algorithm is verified through stringent simulated results. Further, exhaustive benchmarking against the algorithm proposed in the literature is presented to demonstrate the superiority of the proposed algorithm.},

  Abstract                 = {A soft-computing technology is proposed for optimizing the positional compensation parameters for an exposure machine for flexible printed circuit boards (FPCBs). The proposed technology integrates a full-factorial experimental design, a multilayer perceptron (MLP) artificial neural network, and the Taguchi-based genetic algorithm (TBGA). First, a full-factorial experimental design is used to conduct experiments and to accumulate data that represent the positional compensation parameters of an exposure machine. The MLP is then used to build a positioning model of an exposure machine by minimizing the performance criterion of mean-squared error (mse). Finally, the TBGA is used to optimize the positional compensation parameters for the exposure machine. The experimental results demonstrate the excellent performance of the MLP-TBGA approach in obtaining positional compensation parameters for decreasing the number of iterations and the alignment time. For example, in 50 independent runs, the average number of iterations for precision positioning decreased from 4.5 to 3.2, and the alignment time decreased by 41%, if the required positional accuracy was 3 ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¼m.

The sensor-less voltage regulator reduces the complexity of the control system, which makes the proposed converter appealing for industrial applications. An external current controller has been applied for grid-connected application of the introduced sensor-less PUC5 to inject active and reactive power from inverter to the grid with arbitrary power factor, while the PUC auxiliary dc bus is regulated only by sensor-less controller combined with new switching pattern.

  Abstract                 = {More and more industrial infrastructures consider the use of industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) technology to perform control activities in industry. The benefits stemmed from IWSNs include flexible access (no wires are required) to elements that may interact with the factory floor. However, this support introduces new challenges: muling the almost permanent connectivity given by wired infrastructures is no longer available in IWSNs. To address this challenge, this paper explores data muling as the ability of transferring data between different elements within an industrial infrastructure. The proposed data-muling protocol uses a dual discovery and update (D&U) strategy. The prototype evaluation carried out on 6LowPan over IEEE 802.15.4 motes provides some insights on the performance that this type of infrastructure may offer within an industrial context. This paper also offers an extensive benchmark that may be used to test bounds and limitations of the proposed D&U protocol on the industrial use-cases.},

  Abstract                 = {In order to enhance the performance of bearing defect classification, feature extraction and dimensionality reduction have become important. In order to extract the effective features, wavelet kernel local fisher discriminant analysis (WKLFDA) is first proposed; herein, a new wavelet kernel function is proposed to construct the kernel function of LFDA. In order to automatically select the parameters of WKLFDA, a particle swarm optimization (PSO) algorithm is employed, yielding a new PSO-WKLFDA. When compared with the other state-of-the-art methods, the proposed PSO-WKLFDA yields better performance. However, the use of a single global transformation of PSO-WKLFDA for the multiclass task does not provide excellent classification accuracy due to the fact that the projected data still significantly overlap with each other in the projected subspace. In order to enhance the performance of bearing defect classification, a novel method is then proposed by transforming the multiclass task into all possible binary classification tasks using a one-against-one (OAO) strategy. Then, individual PSO-WKLFDA (I-PSO-WKLFDA) is used for extracting effective features of each binary class. The extracted effective features of each binary class are input to a support vector machine (SVM) classifier. Finally, a decision fusion mechanism is employed to merge the classification results from each SVM classifier to identify the bearing condition. Simulation results using synthetic data and experimental results using different bearing fault types show that the proposed method is well suited and effective for bearing defect classification.},

Such identification plays a crucial role in service workflow. The success of a service workflow requires the composition of services where requirements must be satisfied. However, the large-scale open environment of today's Internet poses significant challenges for efficient compliance checking algorithms of those requirements. This paper is based on the previous progressive work on Service Workflow Specification language (SWSpec), the uniformed representation of requirements, and the compliance checking algorithms based on Constrained Truth Table (CTT) and Exclusive Disjunctive Normal Form (EDNF). In this paper, a new algorithm is proposed, which significantly reduces the cost of time complexity. In some cases, this algorithm is able to run in polynomial time. Experiments are conducted to evaluate and compare the performance of these algorithms.},

  Abstract                 = {The Internet of Things (IoT) not only identifies physical and virtual objects, but also enables the connection of such objects in an internet-like structure. In this context, services are one of the most important technologies where IoT can be utilized to enhance dynamic interoperation in the form of service workflows. In opened environments, because services are dynamically gathered, IoT identification is an essential feature which leads to more complicated service composition than before. Since services may possess different requirements, it becomes very challenging to determine suitable services to be a part of a workflow. Compliance of such requirements, reflecting trust-based decision of a service to join a workflow, plays a significant role in the success of service interoperation. This paper presents the compliance checking algorithms for service workflow specification (SWSpec) and service workflow net (SWN) to support trust-based decision for service workflow participation. The application of SWSpec is illustrated using an example of a disaster warning system. Finally, the prototype is developed to evaluate the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

These cyber devices may be tightly coupled with the physical processes they control and human induced failures risk dire real-world consequences. Dynamic virtual honeypots are effective tools for observing and attracting network intruder activity. This paper presents a design and implementation for self-configuring honeypots that passively examine control system network traffic and actively adapt to the observed environment. In contrast to prior work in the field, six tools were analyzed for suitability of network entity information gathering. Ettercap, an established network security tool not commonly used in this capacity, outperformed the other tools and was chosen for implementation. Utilizing Ettercap XML output, a novel four-step algorithm was developed for autonomous creation and update of a Honeyd configuration. This algorithm was tested on an existing small campus grid and sensor network by execution of a collaborative usage scenario. Automatically created virtual hosts were deployed in concert with an anomaly behavior (AB) system in an attack scenario. Virtual hosts were automatically configured with unique emulated network stack behaviors for 92% of the targeted devices. The AB system alerted on 100% of the monitored emulated devices.},

  Abstract                 = {The proliferation of digital devices in a networked industrial ecosystem, along with an exponential growth in complexity and scope, has resulted in elevated security concerns and management complexity issues. This paper describes a novel architecture utilizing concepts of autonomic computing and a simple object access protocol (SOAP)-based interface to metadata access points (IF-MAP) external communication layer to create a network security sensor. This approach simplifies integration of legacy software and supports a secure, scalable, and self-managed framework. The contribution of this paper is twofold: 1) A flexible two-level communication layer based on autonomic computing and service oriented architecture is detailed and 2) three complementary modules that dynamically reconfigure in response to a changing environment are presented. One module utilizes clustering and fuzzy logic to monitor traffic for abnormal behavior. Another module passively monitors network traffic and deploys deceptive virtual network hosts. These components of the sensor system were implemented in C++ and PERL and utilize a common internal D-Bus communication mechanism. A proof of concept prototype was deployed on a mixed-use test network showing the possible real-world applicability. In testing, 45 of the 46 network attached devices were recognized and 10 of the 12 emulated devices were created with specific operating system and port configurations. In addition, the anomaly detection algorithm achieved a 99.9% recognition rate. All output from the modules were correctly distributed using the common communication structure.},

  Abstract                 = {After the technologies of integrated circuits, personal computers, and the Internet, Internet of Things (IoT) is the latest information technology (IT) that is radically changing business paradigms. However, IoT's influence in the manufacturing sector has yet been fully explored. On the other hand, existing computer-aided software tools are experiencing a bottleneck in dealing with complexity, dynamics, and uncertainties in their applications of modern enterprises. It is argued that the adoption of IoT and cloud computing in enterprise systems (ESs) would overcome the bottleneck. In this paper, the challenges in generating assembly plans of complex products are discussed. IoT and cloud computing are proposed to help a conventional assembly modeling system evolve into an advanced system, which is capable to deal with complexity and changes automatically. To achieve this goal, an assembly modeling system is automated, and the proposed system includes the following innovations: 1) the modularized architecture to make the system robust, reliable, flexible, and expandable; 2) the integrated object-oriented templates to facilitate interfaces and reuses of system components; and 3) the automated algorithms to retrieve relational assembly matrices for assembly planning. Assembly modeling for aircraft engines is used as examples to illustrate the system effectiveness.},

  Abstract                 = {Partial least squares (PLS) is an efficient tool widely used in multivariate statistical process monitoring. Since standard PLS performs oblique projection to input space X, it has limitations in distinguishing quality-related and quality-unrelated faults. Several postprocessing modifications of PLS, such as total projection to latent structures (T-PLS), have been proposed to solve this issue. Further studies have found that these modifications fail to reduce false alarm rates (FARs) of quality-unrelated faults when fault amplitude increases. To cope with this problem, this paper proposes an enhanced quality-related fault detection approach based on orthogonal signal correction (OSC) and modified-PLS (M-PLS). The proposed approach removes variation orthogonal to output space Y from input space X before PLS modeling, and further decomposes X into two orthogonal subspaces in which quality-related and quality-unrelated statistical indicators are designed separately. Compared with T-PLS, the proposed approach has a more robust performance and a lower computational load. Two case studies, including a numerical example and the Tennessee Eastman (TE) process, show the effeteness of the proposed approach.},

In the proposed approach, locally weighted projection regression (LWPR) is employed to serve as a powerful tool for modeling the nonlinear process with locally linear models. In each local model, partial least squares (PLS) regression is performed and PLS-based fault detection scheme is applied to monitor the regional model. The diagnosis for the global process is based on the normalized weighted mean of all the local models. Both conventional and quality-related statistical indicators are designed to compute the test statistics.

For practical consideration, robust exact differentiator (RED) technique is utilized to estimate the derivatives of the position signals for controller design.

  Abstract                 = {Device-free wireless localization (DFL) is a promising technique. It can localize and track a target without carrying any electronic device. Compared with traditional received signal strength (RSS)-based DFL, the recently proposed time-of-flight (TOF)-based DFL technique could achieve better performance. However, TOF-based DFL requires that each pair of nodes should perform a pairwise TOF measurement sequentially, which makes it impractical for being utilized in time and energy sensitive applications. Inspired by the fact that a target shadows only a small subset of wireless links, which travel through its spatial impact area, we incorporate link state estimation function into particle filter (PF) framework to predict shadowed links and design a parallel scanning scheme to scan multiple shadowed links simultaneously. The aforementioned methods guarantee that the effective TOF measurements can be acquired timely and energy efficiently. Meanwhile, to achieve reasonable localization performance with these reduced-under-sampled link measurements, we utilize compressive sensing (CS) algorithm to reconstruct the shadowing effect map (SEM). With the map as observation likelihood function, PF algorithm could estimate targets location accurately. Experimental results with an 802.15.4a chirp spread spectrum ranging hardware testbed show that the average running time and energy consumption reduce remarkably.},

This paper, therefore, proposes that the enterprise system should be viewed as a socio-tech system. The paper presents a novel integrated approach to information modeling of socio-tech enterprise systems. In particular, the approach integrates object-orientation, systems-dynamics (as a means to represent high-level dynamics), and aspect-programming.

Therefore, development of advanced tools/platforms for testing operation and control of microgrid has attracted more and more attention nowadays. The current literature reveals that the microgrid's control and management are designed to be tested either in a numerical simulation approach, or only under a specific hardware device/experiment environment; they do not deal with a comprehensive platform capable of easily executing very complex applications built by composing required functionalities in a standardized, easy-to-use, and well-defined way. To address the problem of limited testing functions of existing tools/platforms, a hardware-in-the-loop (HIL) approach, in particular combining a power-HIL (PHIL) and a signal-HIL (SHIL), is proposed in this paper. Such an approach is suitable for testing the system-level controller energy management systems (EMSs) and hardware controllers at signal level, as well as hardware devices like power converters at power level. Hence, this platform is designed for flexibility and universality. The HIL platform is presented in this work and its performance is demonstrated in a sample application.},

In home automation systems, the sound recognized by the system becomes the basis for performing certain tasks. However, if a target source is mixed with another sound due to simultaneous occurrence, the system would generate poor recognition results, subsequently leading to inappropriate responses. To handle such problems, this study proposes a framework, which consists of sound separation and sound verification techniques based on a wireless sensor network (WSN), to realize sound-triggered automation. In the sound separation phase, we present a convolutive blind source separation system with source number estimation using time-frequency clustering. An accurate mixing matrix can be estimated by the proposed phase compensation technique and used for reconstructing the separated sound sources. In the verification phase, Mel frequency cepstral coefficients and Fisher scores that are derived from the wavelet packet decomposition of signals are used as features for support vector machines. Finally, a sound of interest can be selected for triggering automated services according to the verification result. The experimental results demonstrate the robustness and feasibility of the proposed system for mixed sound verification in WSN-based home environments.},

  Abstract                 = {Distributed devices in smart grid systems are decentralized and connected to the power grid through different types of equipment transmit, which will produce numerous energy losses when power flows from one bus to another. One of the most efficient approaches to reduce energy losses is to integrate distributed generations (DGs), mostly renewable energy sources. However, the uncertainty of DG may cause instability issues. Additionally, due to the similar consumption habits of customers, the peak load period of power consumption may cause congestion in the power grid and affect the energy delivery. Energy management with DG regulation is considered to be one of the most efficient solutions for solving these instability issues. In this paper, we consider a power system with both distributed generators and customers, and propose a distributed locational marginal pricing (DLMP)-based unified energy management system (uEMS) model, which, unlike previous works, considers both increasing profit benefits for DGs and increasing stability of the distributed power system (DPS). The model contains two parts: 1) a game theory-based loss reduction allocation (LRA); and 2) a load feedback control (LFC) with price elasticity. In the former component, we develop an iterative loss reduction method using DLMP to remunerate DGs for their participation in energy loss reduction. By using iterative LRA to calculate energy loss reduction, the model accurately rewards DG contribution and offers a fair competitive market. Furthermore, the overall profit of all DGs is maximized by utilizing game theory to calculate an optimal LRA scheme for calculating the distributed loss of every DG in each time slot. In the latter component of the model, we propose an LFC submodel with price elasticity, where a DLMP feedback signal is calculated by customer demand to regulate peak-load value. In uEMS, LFC first determines the DLMP signal of a customer bus by a time-shift load optimization (LO) algorithm ba- ed on the changes of customer demand, which is fed back to the DLMP of the customer bus at the next slot-time, allowing for peak-load regulation via price elasticity. Results based on the IEEE 37-bus feeder system show that the proposed uEMS model can increase DG benefits and improve system stability.},

  Abstract                 = {Mars entry phase is the most challenging part among Mars entry, descent, and landing (EDL). One of the main reasons is that the lander suffers tough tests from the uncertainties, which include atmospheric density, lift over drag ratio, ballistic coefficient, and initial conditions. In this paper, the desensitized extended Kalman filter (DEKF) is introduced. State estimations from DEKF are obtained by minimizing a cost function that is composed of the trace of posterior covariance matrix and the weighted norm of the posterior state estimation error sensitivities (PSEES). By applying inertial measurement unit (IMU), Mars orbiters and Mars surface beacons (MSBs) integrated navigation simulations demonstrate that the introduced DEKF is far less sensitive to uncertain parameters than standard EKF during Mars entry. With the increase of uncertainties one by one, the root-mean-square errors (RMSE) of the states are still convergent in case of DEKF as compared to standard EKF where they become larger. At last, the consistency test is carried on to further validate the proposed DEKF.},

  Abstract                 = {Today's manufacturing environments are very dynamic and turbulent. Traditional enterprise information systems (EISs) have mostly been implemented upon hierarchical architectures, which are inflexible to adapt changes and uncertainties promptly. Next-generation EISs must be agile and adaptable to accommodate changes without significant time delays. It is essential for an EIS to obtain real-time data from the distributed and dynamic manufacturing environment for decision making. Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) and radio-frequency identification (RFID) systems provide an excellent infrastructure for data acquisition, distribution, and processing. In this paper, some key challenges related to the integration of WSN and RFID technologies are discussed. A five-layer system architecture has been proposed to achieve synergistic performance. For the integration of WSN and RFID, one of the critical issues is the low efficiency of communication due to redundant data as redundant data increases energy consumption and causes time delay. To address it, an improved data cleaning algorithm has been proposed; its feasibility and effectiveness have been verified via simulation and a comparison with a published algorithm. To illustrate the capacity of the developed architecture and new data cleaning algorithm, their application in relief supplies storage management has been discussed.},

A new formalism is developed to assign periodic tasks with multiple-periods. By implementing SCT, a real-time system (RTS) is dynamically reconfigured when its initial safe execution sequence set is empty. During the reconfiguration process, based on the multiple-periods, the supervisor proposes different safe execution sequences. Two real-world examples illustrate that the presented approach provides an increased number of safe execution sequences as compared with the earliest-deadline-first (EDF) scheduling algorithm.},

As in wireless communications systems, exploiting the temporal, spatial, and technological diversities in multiple cooperative MGs could bring about more efficient power generation and distribution. This paper investigates a hierarchical power scheduling approach to optimally manage power trading, storage, and distribution in a smart power grid with a macrogrid and cooperative MGs. We first formulate the problem as a convex optimization problem and then decompose it into a two-tier formulation. The first-tier problem jointly considers user utility, transmission cost, and grid load variance, while the second-tier problem minimizes the power generation and transmission cost, and exploits distributed storage in the MGs. We develop an effective online algorithm to solve the first-tier problem and prove its asymptotic optimality, as well as a distributed optimal algorithm for solving the second-tier problem. The proposed algorithms are evaluated with trace-driven simulations and are shown to outperform several existing schemes with considerable gains.},

The parallel straight lines are distorted according to the shape of the weld pool and thus contain the weld pool's shape information. Accurately computing the equations of the imaged laser lines in the world coordinate system is critical for the subsequent weld pool shape estimation.

Windowed interpolation fast Fourier transformation (WIFFT) is an efficient algorithm for power system harmonic estimation, which can eliminate the errors caused by spectral leakage and picket fence effect. However, the fitting polynomial in the interpolation procedure contains both even and odd terms, and this increases the computational burden. This paper proposes a simple symmetrical interpolation FFT algorithm, where the even terms are removed from the fitting polynomial based on the triangular self-convolution windows (TSCW). The polynomials for frequency and amplitude computations are provided. Considerable leakage errors and harmonic interferences can be suppressed by the TSCW. Accurate estimations of harmonic parameters can be obtained via the fitting polynomial and the TSCW, both with adjustable order to fulfill different accuracy and speed requirements of practical power harmonic measurement.

  Abstract                 = {Building Energy Management Systems (BEMSs) are essential components of modern buildings that are responsible for minimizing energy consumption while maintaining occupant comfort. However, since indoor environment is dependent on many uncertain criteria, performance of BEMS can be suboptimal at times. Unfortunately, complexity of BEMSs, large amount of data, and interrelations between data can make identifying these suboptimal behaviors difficult. This paper proposes a novel Fuzzy Anomaly Detection and Linguistic Description (Fuzzy-ADLD)-based method for improving the understandability of BEMS behavior for improved state-awareness. The presented method is composed of two main parts: 1) detection of anomalous BEMS behavior; and 2) linguistic representation of BEMS behavior. The first part utilizes modified nearest neighbor clustering algorithm and fuzzy logic rule extraction technique to build a model of normal BEMS behavior. The second part of the presented method computes the most relevant linguistic description of the identified anomalies. The presented Fuzzy-ADLD method was applied to real-world BEMS system and compared against a traditional alarm-based BEMS. Six different scenarios were tested, and the presented Fuzzy-ADLD method identified anomalous behavior either as fast as or faster (an hour or more) than the alarm based BEMS.

In this study, two new thresholding methods, namely contrast-adjusted Otsu's method and contrast-adjusted median-based Otsu's method, are proposed for automated defect detection system for titanium-coated aluminum surfaces. The two proposed methods were compared with four existing thresholding techniques in terms of accuracy and speed of defect detections for images of 700, 900, and 1000 dpi obtained using high-resolution scanning. Experimental results have shown that the proposed contrast-adjusting methods have performance similar to minimum error thresholding (MET) and are generally better than Otsu's method.},

The former estimated parameters are used to calculate the exact optimal LEPA online to improve the performance of the current ZCD elimination scheme.

In the proposed topology, a bidirectional power switch is added to the standard single-phase cascaded multilevel inverter (CMI) to implement the transformation between CMI mode and H-bridge inverter (HBI) mode. An online topology transformation approach of the MCM-GCI is proposed to guarantee the topology modes transformed safely and smoothly. The proposed MCM-GCI operates in CMI mode when the PV arrays' output voltage and power are low, and transforms into HBI mode when the PV arrays' output voltage and power are high. Experimental results of five-level MCM-GCI are represented to validate the feasibility of the proposed topology and it is also compared with other three classic grid-connected inverters to highlight its advantages. Furthermore, more structures based on hybrid CMI, which possess the topology transformation ability, are shown to further improve the generation range and obtain a higher efficiency of the system.},

This paper aims to investigate a hybrid energy trading market that is comprised of an external utility company and a local trading market managed by a local trading center (LTC). The existence of local energy market provides new opportunities for the energy consumers and the distributed energy sellers to perform the local energy trading in a cooperative manner such that they all can benefit. This paper first quantifies the respective benefits of the energy consumers and the sellers from the local trading and then investigates how they can optimize their benefits by controlling their energy scheduling in response to the LTC's pricing. Two different types of the LTC are considered: 1) the nonprofit-oriented LTC, which solely aims at benefiting the energy consumers and the sellers; and 2) the profit-oriented LTC, which aims at maximizing its own profit while guaranteeing the required benefit for each consumer and seller. For each type of the LTC, the optimal trading problem is formulated and the associated algorithm is further proposed to efficiently find the LTC's optimal price, as well as the optimal energy scheduling for each consumer and seller. Numerical results are provided to validate the benefits of the hybrid energy trading market and the performance of the proposed algorithms.},

To resolve this contradiction, this paper presents an effective method to simplify the conventional FCS-MPC. With equivalent transformation and specialized sector distribution method, the computation load of FCS-MPC is greatly reduced while the control performance is not affected.

Virtualization allows to instantiate virtual machines (VMs) on top of fewer physical systems managed by a VM manager. Performance evaluation of clouds is required to evaluate and quantify the cost-benefit of a strategy portfolio and the quality of service (QoS) experienced by end-users. Such evaluation is not feasible by means of simulation or on-the-field measurement, due to the great scale of parameter spaces that have to be traversed. In this study, we present a stochastic-queuing-network-based approach to performance analysis of migration-enabled clouds in error-prone environment. Several performance metrics are defined and evaluated: utilization, expected task completion time, and task rejection rate under different load conditions and error intensities. To validate the proposed approach, we obtain experimental performance data through a real-world cloud and conduct a confidence-interval analysis. The analysis results suggest the perfect coverage of theoretical performance results by corresponding experimental confidence intervals.},

Recent research shows more potential applications of IoT in information intensive industrial sectors such as healthcare services.

Meanwhile, the use of IoT technology in applications has spurred the increase of real-time data, which makes the information storage and accessing more difficult and challenging. In this research, first a semantic data model is proposed to store and interpret IoT data. Then a resource-based data accessing method (UDA-IoT) is designed to acquire and process IoT data ubiquitously to improve the accessibility to IoT data resources. Finally, we present an IoT-based system for emergency medical services to demonstrate how to collect, integrate, and interoperate IoT data flexibly in order to provide support to emergency medical services. The result shows that the resource-based IoT data accessing method is effective in a distributed heterogeneous data environment for supporting data accessing timely and ubiquitously in a cloud and mobile computing platform.},

However, general time-based DR is basically a passive tariff. Utilities usually create general pricing tariff to the whole industrial consumers at the same voltage connection level. Under this situation, consumption transformation of all possible industries occurs together. It may reduce the effect of load characteristics improvement. This paper introduces a new pricing framework named active time-based (ATB) DR to overcome this weak point. Under this tariff, consumers are classified in details. Utilities select target consumers, communicate with them actively, and provide a specified price curve for the industries covered by target consumer group. With a practical survey, this paper implements ATB with the best behavioral scheme (BBS) model and industrial consumer attitude model. This paper includes a numerical case study on cement manufacturing for further analysis. Data acquisition, BBS simulation, consumer attitude estimation, and an investigation on electricity pricing are covered by this case study.},

  Abstract                 = {The internet-of-things (IoT) technology allows auto-organized and intelligent entities such as services to be interoperable and able to act independently. This enables the advanced form of service composition by allowing individual services to dynamically form a service workflow. In this context, services possess different requirements where the compliance of such requirements reflects trust-based decision for participating in a workflow. Large-scale service interoperations pose significant challenges for compliance checking of those requirements. These include inconsistency of requirements that can be represented in different formats and dynamicity, where a workflow can be modified based on service creation, modification, or termination. These factors directly affect the decision of a service to be part of a workflow. To solve these problems, service workflow specification (SWSpec) has been proposed as a consistent and uniformed representation of requirements, and algorithms based on constrained truth table (CTT) have been developed for automatic compliance checking. In this paper, the architecture of these elements is created to facilitate 1) a workflow owner in specifying properties of services to be part of a workflow and 2) services to express their requirements where their compliance reflects trust-based participation decision.},

This paper presents the design, implementation, and control of a piezoelectrically actuated compliant gripper with combined position and force monitoring/control capabilities. The gripper structure is devised based on a compliant rotary bearing mechanism with the displacement amplification lever, which endows a simplified architecture than the existing parallelogram-based ones. Moreover, the challenge of achieving a smooth transition between the position and force switching control is addressed by means of a new incremental control scheme. Precision control under the influence of hysteretic nonlinearity is guaranteed by a discrete sliding-mode control algorithm. The scheme is implemented with an field-programmable gate array (FPGA) platform. Experimental investigations are undertaken to verify the effectiveness of the gripper system by executing grasp-hold-release operations of a micro copper wire. The results confirm that the proposed incremental-based switching control outperforms conventional approach in terms of position/force regulation accuracy and operation time.},

An effective distributed strategy based on distributed dynamic programming algorithm is proposed to optimally allocate the total power demand among different generation units considering the generation limits and ramping rate limits. The proposed distributed strategy is implemented based on a multiagent system framework which only requires local computation and communication among neighboring agents. Thus, it enables the sharing of computational and communication burden among distributed agents. In addition, the proposed strategy can be implemented with asynchronous communication, which may lead to simpler implementation and faster convergence speed. Simulation results with a four-generator system and the IEEE 162-bus system are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed distributed strategy.},

Signal interpretation in these systems might become challenging due to multimodal and dispersive response of the interrogated structure.

This paper compares the use of Maximal Length Sequences and linear chirp excitation signals to develop a novel signal processing technique using dispersion compensation and cross-correlation. The technique is applied to both simulated and experimental multimodal signals from an aluminium rod for performance assessment. It is quantitatively validated that the technique noticeably improves the signal-to-noise ratio of the guided wave response and is able to acquire an accurate time of flight of the individual wave modes, and hence, the propagation distance. The technique is compared for both linear chirp and maximal length sequences excitation signals. Noise analysis for these excitation signals is also presented.},

  Abstract                 = {Industrial wireless sensor network (IWSN) is a key enabling technology for the Internet-of-things (IoT). IWSN acts as one of the fundamental elements of the IoT infrastructure to bridge the physical sensors and actuators in field and backbone systems in the Internet. For deterministic performances, all mainstream IWSN standards utilize the slotted media access control (MAC) where the communication is allocated based on the superframe that comprises a number of slots in either contention-based access or contention-free access modes. In this paper, the planning of the superframe structure of the slotted MAC is investigated by two means: 1) a mathematical model of the MAC access latency based on the queue theory; and 2) an easy-to-use software tool based on packet-level simulation. The mathematical model gives an overall estimation of the average MAC access latency of the whole network. The software tool gives the exact latency of each packet and then can derive the optimal superframe structure of the network. The two means are validated correspondingly. With the methods proposed in this paper, IWSN designers can minimize the MAC access latency while satisfying the requirements at different generating rates of packet, number of nodes in the network, and packet buffer length of each node.},

  Abstract                 = {A new continuous dynamic sliding-mode control (CDSMC) method is proposed for high-order mismatched disturbance attenuation in motion control systems using a high-order sliding-mode differentiator. First, a new dynamic sliding surface is developed by incorporating the information of the estimates of disturbances and their high-order derivatives. A CDSMC law is then designed for a general motion control system with both high-order matched and mismatched disturbances, which can attenuate the effects of disturbances from the system output. The proposed control method is finally applied for the airgap control of a MAGnetic LEViation (MAGLEV) suspension vehicle. Simulation results show that the proposed method exhibits promising control performance in the presence of high-order matched and mismatched disturbances.},

This is an interdisciplinary method that integrates the researches of optics, data mining, and image processing. Because objects have unique but imperfect surfaces, their laser speckle is capable of providing suitable identifiable features for authentication. In our method, matching points among speckle images acquired from one plastic card are extracted by scale-invariant feature transform (SIFT). The spatial relations among the matching points are then transformed to 9 direction lower triangular (9DLT) representations. Then, the Apriori algorithm mines frequent patterns so a useful association rule is obtained as the feature to identify the similarity between each of the speckle images for the purpose of authenticity verification. The proposed method is especially robust in the cases of card displacement and luminance change resulted from laser attenuation. Experimental results show that the proposed method has promising results and outperforms existing methods in identification accuracy.},

MVC is used to encode stereoscopic video streams for 3D playout systems such as 3D television, digital cinema, and IP network applications. MVC is an extended version of H.264/AVC that improves the performance of multiview videos. Yet, when compared with single-view video coding, MVC consumes much more time when encoding large amounts of data. Speed-up algorithms, therefore, are essential for realizing related applications. This paper presents a fast mode decision algorithm to avoid the high computational complexity of MVC. The proposed approach aims to reduce candidate modes and make mode decision process more efficient. The minimum and maximum values of rate-distortion cost (RD cost) in the previously encoded view are used to compute a threshold for each mode in the current view. Compared with joint multiview video coding, the experimental results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm provides an average of 79% in time savings with negligible bit rate increase and peak signal-to-noise ratio decrease.},

In order to represent different performance and requirements of the battery and UC packs, the two packs are modeled as two independent but related agents using the NetLogo environment. Utility functions are designed to describe the respective preferences of battery and UC packs. Then, the control problem is converted to a multiobjective optimization problem solved by using the Karush-Kuhn-Tucker (KKT) conditions. The weights in the objective functions are chosen based on the location of the knee point in the Pareto set. Both the simulation and experimental results show the utility function-based control provides a comparable performance with the ideal average load demand (ALD)-based control, while the exact preknowledge of the future load demand is not required. The utility function-based control is fast enough to be directly implemented in real time. The discussion in this paper gives a starting point and initial results for dealing with more complex hybrid energy systems.},

EV mobility is a unique and inherent feature of the V2G system. However, the inter-relationship between EV mobility and DRM is not obvious. In this paper, we focus on the exploration of EV mobility to impact DRM in V2G systems in smart grid. We first present a dynamic complex network model of V2G mobile energy networks, considering the fact that EVs travel across multiple districts, and hence EVs can be acting as energy transporters among different districts. We formulate the districts' DRM dynamics, which is coupled with each other through EV fleets. In addition, a complex network synchronization method is proposed to analyze the dynamic behavior in V2G mobile energy networks. Numerical results show that EVs mobility of symmetrical EV fleet is able to achieve synchronous stability of network and balance the power demand among different districts. This observation is also validated by simulation with real world data.},

  Abstract                 = {As an important part of industrial application (IA), the wireless sensor network (WSN) has been an active research area over the past few years. Due to the limited energy and communication ability of sensor nodes, it seems especially important to design a routing protocol for WSNs so that sensing data can be transmitted to the receiver effectively. An energy-balanced routing method based on forward-aware factor (FAF-EBRM) is proposed in this paper.

  Abstract                 = {The Internet of Things (IoT) opens up tremendous opportunities to location-based industrial applications that leverage both Internet-resident resources and phones' processing power and sensors to provide location information. Location-based service is one of the vital applications in commercial, economic, and public domains. In this paper, we propose a novel localization scheme called NextMe, which is based on cellular phone traces. We find that the mobile call patterns are strongly correlated with the co-locate patterns. We extract such correlation as social interplay from cellular calls, and use it for location prediction from temporal and spatial perspectives. NextMe consists of data preprocessing, call pattern recognition, and a hybrid predictor. To design the call pattern recognition module, we introduce the notions of critical calls and corresponding patterns. In addition, NextMe does not require that the cell tower addresses should be bounded with concrete coordinates, e.g., global positioning system (GPS) coordinates. We validate NextMe across MIT Reality Mining Dataset, involving 500 000 h of continuous behavior information and 112 508 cellular calls. Experimental results show that NextMe achieves fine-grained prediction accuracy at cell tower level in the forthcoming 1-6 h with 12% accuracy enhancement averagely from cellular calls.},

  Abstract                 = {Energy-harvested wireless sensor networks may operate perpetually with extra energy supply from natural energy such as solar energy. Nevertheless, harvested energy is often too limited to support perpetual network operation with full duty cycle. To achieve perpetual network operation and process the data with high importance, measured by value of information (VoI), sensor nodes have to operate under partial duty cycle and to improve the efficiency of harvested energy. A challenging problem is how to deal with the stochastic feature of natural energy and variable data VoI. We consider the energy consumption during the energy storage and the diversity of the data process including sampling, transmitting, and receiving, which consume different power levels. The problem is then mapped as a budget-dynamic multiarm bandit problem by treating harvested energy as budget and the data process as arm pulling. This paper proposes an opportunistic duty cycling (ODC) scheme to improve the energy efficiency while satisfying perpetual network operation. ODC chooses some proper opportunities to store harvested energy or to spend it on the data process based on historical information of energy harvesting and VoI of the processed data. With this scheme, each sensor node only needs to estimate ambient natural energy in short term so as to reduce computation cost and storage capacity for the historical information. It then can adjust its own duty cycle distributively with its local historical information. This paper conducts extensive theoretical analysis for the performance of our scheme ODC on the regret, which is the difference between the optimal scheme and ours. Our experimental results also manifest the promising performance of ODC.},

The advantage of the proposed controller lies in the fact that its implementation only requires a simple step-response process model, whereas controller design can be based on state space formulation to improve temperature regulation. To ensure control performance effectiveness under model/process mismatch and uncertainties, model predictions and the cost function optimization are done on the basis of a new improved state space model. The proposed MPC is applied to an industrial coke furnace, where the outlet temperature in the radiation room is regulated. Simulation comparisons with traditional state space MPC are illustrated first. Then experimental results are shown in comparison with the original proportional-integral differential (PID) controller, demonstrating the effectiveness of the proposed methodology.},

The sensor network is considered to be a peer-to-peer network without an estimation center.

One important goal of optimal energy management (OEM) is to maximize the social welfare through the coordination of the suppliers' generations and customers' demands. Thus, it is desirable to consider the interactive operation of economic dispatch and DR, and solve them in an integrated way. This paper proposes a fully distributed online OEM solution for smart grids. The proposed solution considers the economic dispatch of conventional generators, DR of users, and operating conditions of renewable generators all together. The proposed distributed solution is developed based on a market-based self-interests motivation model since this model can realize the global social welfare maximization among system participants. The proposed solution can be implemented with multiagent system with each system participant assigned with an energy management agent. Based on the designed distributed algorithms for price updating and supply-demand mismatch discovery, the OEM among agents can be achieved in a distributed way. Simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed solution.},

  Abstract                 = {INTRA video coding is essential for high quality mobile video communication and industrial video applications since it enhances video quality, prevents error propagation, and facilitates random access. The latest high-efficiency video coding (HEVC) standard has adopted flexible quad-tree-based block structure and complex angular INTRA prediction to improve the coding efficiency. However, these technologies increase the coding complexity significantly, which consumes large hardware resources, computing time and power cost, and is an obstacle for real-time video applications. To reduce the coding complexity and save power cost, we propose a fast INTRA coding unit (CU) depth decision method based on statistical modeling and correlation analyses. First, we analyze the spatial CU depth correlation with different textures and present effective strategies to predict the most probable depth range based on the spatial correlation among CUs. Since the spatial correlation may fail for image boundary and transitional areas between textural and smooth areas, we then present a statistical model-based CU decision approach in which adaptive early termination thresholds are determined and updated based on the rate-distortion (RD) cost distribution, video content, and quantization parameters (QPs). Experimental results show that the proposed method can reduce the complexity by about 56.76% and 55.61% on average for various sequences and configurations; meanwhile, the RD degradation is negligible.},

  Abstract                 = {Dynamic process adjustment is an important way for improving product quality in industry production process. Focusing on the process monitoring and feedback adjustment, a residual prediction method for quality improvement is proposed in this paper. This method deals with the problem of dynamic process adjustment in three steps: 1) definition of adjustment rules; 2) building of residual series model; and 3) prediction of adjustment amount, respectively. First, the cost function and quality loss are combined to define the adjustment rules, which is used for judging whether the process should be adjusted. Second, a multivariate residual series model is built to illustrate the time series between input variables (technological parameters) and output variables (quality indices). Third, the double-order weights are introduced to support vector machine to build a prediction model for predicting the adjustment amount of controllable variables. In this way, the adjustment decisions can be made and conducted to realize the dynamic process adjustment. At last, to demonstrate the practical usefulness of the proposed method, a case study about coating process of purifier carrier is provided to validate its effectiveness. The result shows that the proposed method has good performance for industry application.},

  Abstract                 = {The consensus problem of networked Euler-Lagrange systems is studied in this paper. Different from the continuous-time communication setting, a novel sampled-data communication strategy is proposed, which is more reliable and applicable in practice. In particular, the sampling period is described by a probabilistic model. Furthermore, the communication network burden is lower since only the coordinate information is required to be exchanged. By efficiently utilizing the communication network to transfer the sampled-data information, an advantage of our consensus protocol is that the communication energy consumption can be efficiently reduced. Based on the Lyapunov-Krasovskii method, sufficient conditions are derived to ensure that the consensus can be achieved. Finally, a two-link manipulator example is provided to demonstrate the effectiveness and advantage of our proposed method.},

  Abstract                 = {Internet of Things (IoT) allows connected objects to communicate via the Internet. IoT can benefit from the unlimited capabilities and resources of cloud computing. Also, when coupled with IoT, cloud computing can in turn deal with real world things in a more distributed and dynamic manner. As the cloud market becomes more open and competitive, Quality of Service (QoS) will be more important. However, cloud providers and cloud consumers have different, and sometimes opposite, preferences. If such a conflict occurs, a Service Level Agreement (SLA) cannot be reached without negotiation. A tradeoff negotiation approach can outperform a concession approach in terms of utility, but may incur more failures if information is incomplete. To balance utility and success rate, we propose a mixed approach for cloud service negotiation, which is based on the ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂgame of chicken.ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂÃÂ In particular, if one is uncertain about the strategy of its counterpart, it is best to mix concession and tradeoff strategies in negotiation. To evaluate the effectiveness of this approach, we conduct extensive simulations. Results show that a mixed negotiation approach can achieve a higher utility than a concession approach, while incurring fewer failures than a tradeoff approach.},

  Abstract                 = {Cloud computing is an important component of the backbone of the Internet of Things (IoT). Clouds will be required to support large numbers of interactions with varying quality requirements. Service quality will therefore be an important differentiator among cloud providers. In order to distinguish themselves from their competitors, cloud providers should offer superior services that meet customers' expectations. A quality model can be used to represent, measure, and compare the quality of the providers, such that a mutual understanding can be established among cloud stakeholders. In this paper, we take a service perspective and initiate a quality model named CLOUDQUAL for cloud services. It is a model with quality dimensions and metrics that targets general cloud services. CLOUDQUAL contains six quality dimensions, i.e., usability, availability, reliability, responsiveness, security, and elasticity, of which usability is subjective, whereas the others are objective. To demonstrate the effectiveness of CLOUDQUAL, we conduct empirical case studies on three storage clouds. Results show that CLOUDQUAL can evaluate their quality. To demonstrate its soundness, we validate CLOUDQUAL with standard criteria and show that it can differentiate service quality.},

  Abstract                 = {Multiobjective optimal reactive power dispatch (MORD) is a highly constrained nonlinear nondifferential multimodal Pareto optimization problem with a mixture of continuous and discrete variables. This paper presents a novel strength Pareto multigroup search optimizer (SPMGSO) for solving this challenging problem. In the proposed algorithm, a number of enhancement mechanisms, such as ring-migration synergistic cooperation, crowding entropy constraint treatment, and chaotic logistic dispersion, were developed to effectively strengthen the diversity and distribution of the resulting nondominated front (NDF). The final best compromise solution is then extracted from the NDF using a hierarchical clustering and an equilibria-based multicriteria decision-making scheme. In addition, the multicore processing was introduced to parallelize the multigroup search so as to greatly improve the execution speed of the algorithm. Computational studies on the benchmark IEEE 30-bus and 162-bus power systems have confirmed the superior performance and improvement of the proposed algorithm for solving this Pareto problem, and demonstrated its applicability and capability to cope with the high-dimensional MORD problems with multiple operational objectives.},

The Gaussian mixture probability hypothesis density (GM-PHD) filter, which aims to recursively propagate the intensity associated with the multi-target posterior density, can overcome the difficulty caused by the data association. This paper develops a multi-target visual tracking system that combines the GM-PHD filter with object detection. First, a new birth intensity estimation algorithm based on entropy distribution and coverage rate is proposed to automatically and accurately track the newborn targets in a noisy video. Then, a robust game-theoretical mutual occlusion handling algorithm with an improved spatial color appearance model is proposed to effectively track the targets in mutual occlusion. The spatial color appearance model is improved by incorporating interferences of other targets within the occlusion region. Finally, the experiments conducted on publicly available videos demonstrate the good performance of the proposed visual tracking system.},

  Abstract                 = {Wireless sensor networks (WSNs) are integrated as a pillar of collaborative Internet of Things (IoT) technologies for the creation of pervasive smart environments. Generally, IoT end nodes (or WSN sensors) can be mobile or static. In this kind of hybrid WSNs, mobile sinks move to predetermined sink locations to gather data sensed by static sensors. Scheduling mobile sinks energy-efficiently while prolonging the network lifetime is a challenge. To remedy this issue, we propose a three-phase energy-balanced heuristic. Specifically, the network region is first divided into grid cells with the same geographical size. These grid cells are assigned to clusters through an algorithm inspired by the k-dimensional tree algorithm, such that the energy consumption of each cluster is similar when gathering data. These clusters are adjusted by (de)allocating grid cells contained in these clusters, while considering the energy consumption of sink movement. Consequently, the energy to be consumed in each cluster is approximately balanced considering the energy consumption of both data gathering and sink movement. Experimental evaluation shows that this technique can generate an optimal grid cell division within a limited time of iterations and prolong the network lifetime.},

  Abstract                 = {High-precision current control is demanded for many mechatronic systems to improve the static and dynamic performances. However, current measurement error inherent in the measurement system degrade the control accuracy, since the motor currents are not guaranteed to follow the desired references. In this paper, quantization error caused by analog-to-digital converters is studied. The dithering techniques combined with Kalman filter are proposed to suppress the quantization effects. First, two dithered systems, including the subtractively dithered and nonsubtractively dithered systems, are designed to whiten the quantization error. In the design of nonsubtractively dithered system, the probability characteristic of the metering noise is utilized to minimize the measurement noise level. Then, Kalman filter is designed to estimate the real current signals from the dithered current measurements. Since the variance of the total measurement error is theoretically calculable according to the proposed dithering techniques, Kalman gain can be determined analytically. Finally, simulations and experiments are performed to verify the effectiveness of the proposed approaches using a high-precision positioning system.},

  Abstract                 = {Facilitated by advanced information and communication technologies (ICT) infrastructure and optimization techniques, smart grid has the potential to bring significant benefits to the energy consumption management. This paper presents a game theoretic consumption scheduling framework based on the use of mixed integer programming (MIP) to schedule consumption plan for residential consumers. In particular, the optimization framework incorporates integration of locally generated renewable energy in order to minimize dependency on conventional energy and the consumption cost. The game theoretic model is designed to coordinatively manage the scheduling of appliances of consumers. The Nash equilibrium of the game exists and the scheduling optimization converges to an equilibrium where all consumers can benefit from participating in. Simulation results are presented to demonstrate the proposed approach and the benefits of home demand management.},

  Abstract                 = {In view of many problems associated with harmonics pollution within industrial firms, the development of new passive and/or hybrid filtering techniques of higher quality, higher efficiency, and lower cost is a necessity for the forthcoming power quality age. This article suggests a hybrid passive filter, which consists of a certain combination of a shunt passive filter (SPF) with a series passive portion as a substitute to overcome the shortcomings of conventional shunt passive filtering techniques. Constrained optimization is used to find the optimal sizing of parameters of the hybrid passive filter in order to reduce both harmonic voltages and harmonic currents in the power system to an acceptable level, as well as to improve the load power factor. The optimal design of the hybrid passive filter and its feasibility are compared with those of the C-type passive filter and the conventional SPF by means of four study cases taken from existing publications. Several simulation results are shown in order to highlight the viability of the proposed filter.},

  Abstract                 = {Delay is inevitable in digital-controlled system and the delay will change system phase-frequency characteristic, thus affecting system stability. The system stability of inductor-capacitor-inductor (LCL)-type grid-connected inverter with single-loop control based on inverter-side current and single-loop control based on grid-side current is analyzed both in continuous and discrete domains. The influence of delay time on system stability is systematically studied. A delay time control method that is capable of adjusting delay time is further proposed to improve system stability. The proposed delay time control method is applied in the experiment, making an unstable system to be stable, and verifies the analysis result and proposed method.},
