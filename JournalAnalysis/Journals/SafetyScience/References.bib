  Abstract                 = {Abstract Assurance of well integrity is critical and important in all stages of operation of oil and gas reservoirs. In this study, well integrity is modeled during casing and cementing operations. Two different approaches are adapted to model potential failure scenarios. The first approach analyzes failure scenarios using bow-tie model which offers a better visual representation of the logical relationships among the contributing factors through Boolean gates. The second approach takes advantage of Bayesian network, both to model conditional dependencies and to perform probability updating. The analysis identified managed pressure drilling system, logging tool, slurry formulation, casing design, casing handling and running method, surge and swab pressures as critical elements of the well integrity model. A diagnostic analysis on the slurry formulation further identified pilot test(s) and the interpretation of the test(s) as key elements to ensuring integrity of cementing operation. Relevant safety functions and inherent safety principles to improve well integrity operations are also explored. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The exploration and development of oil and gas resources located in extreme and harsh offshore environments are characterized with high safety risk and drilling cost. Some of these resources would be either uneconomical if extracted using conventional overbalanced drilling due to increased drilling problems and prolonged non-productive time, or too risky to adopt underbalanced drilling technique. Seeking new ways to reduce drilling cost and minimize risks has led to the development of managed pressure drilling techniques. Managed pressure drilling methods address the drawbacks of conventional overbalanced and underbalanced drilling techniques. As managed pressure drilling techniques are evolving, there are many unanswered questions related to safety and operating pressure regime. This study investigates the safety and operational issues of constant bottom-hole pressure drilling technique which is used in managed pressure drilling compared to conventional overbalanced drilling. The study first uses bow-tie models to map safety challenges and operating pressure regimes in constant bottom-hole pressure drilling technique. Due to the difficulties in modeling dependencies and updating the belief on the operational data, the bow-ties are mapped into Bayesian networks. The Bayesian networks are thoroughly analyzed to assess the safety critical elements of constant bottom-hole pressure drilling techniques and their safe operating pressure regime. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The more the risk level the lesser the safety and vice versa. The history of risk evaluation is moving from the point of accident investigation toward prior determination of quantum risk level. The risk level assessment is a part of risk evaluation process for identifying the risk aspects, impacts, hazard significance, and operational hazards. Risk assessment process helps for appropriate design of risk control procedures, to suggest provision of safety adequacy measures to reduce risk consequences, avoid or mitigate risks, and hazards. Risk free and failure free or fail-safe Operations in Safety-Critical Systems may not lead to loss of equipment, financial loss, environmental damage and hazard to human life. Prevailing standard techniques point out various risk factors and map out potential points where a safety critical operation can fail. The development of a framework is based on prevailing applicable standards and deals with safety–risk assessment for safety automation of safety-critical system operations. To explore various underlying risk factors, impacts and evaluation for determining risk magnitude, attributes and probabilities exhaustively considering practical conditions, a framework for safety automation of safety-critical operations is proposed. The methodology identifies underlying risk factors and determines risk significance for occupational and financial. Based on the identifications, a ten point scale to assess safety–risks is derived. The results of framework application to power plant case showed substantial improvement in assessing risks when compared to existing risk assessments. This is an indication of prevailing limited/inadequate safety–risk assessment in deeply addressing associated operational risks, proving the framework useful. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper explores job conditions that influence health and well-being in the specific context of workers fulfilling environmental protection requirements on board ships. The aim is to understand how environmental compliance might compromise health and safety in the workplace. High-involvement work practices are known to affect occupational health and well-being adversely through increased stress. However, the nature and extent of job stress attributable to the activity of environmental compliance has not been previously examined among workers performing the task occasionally and as non-specialists. A case study using qualitative semi-structured interviews was implemented. Forty-one interviews including 34 ship crews and 7 managers were conducted at a \{UK\} based global shipping company and aboard two of its ships. Thematic analysis was incorporated to analyse the data. Five thematic categories reflecting job conditions which ship crews and their managers described as potentially influencing the work experience associated with environmental compliance emerged from the interviews: (1) design of tasks, (2) management style, (3) interpersonal relationships, (4) career concerns, and (5) physical conditions. On balance, the paper concludes that environmental compliance does appear to influence the health and well-being of ship crews in negative ways, in particular by inducing job demands which add to the heavy workload and long working hours that ship crews are already faced with. Understanding the impact of compliance on longer term health is essential. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Safety is always critical aspect for marine industry since there are numerous perils at sea and those may result loss of ship, environment pollution, human injury and even loss of life. The studies show that the most of marine accidents are due to decision error (Chauvin et al., 2013) as the human factors are one of the main contributory factors of marine accident particularly grounding of ships at sea. In this context, maritime authorities struggle to decrease marine accidents at sea by enforcing rules and regulations. However, the marine accidents are still on-going. This paper primarily deals with potential navigational contingencies in particular grounding incident by proposing a hybrid accident analysis method to enhance safety in marine industry. The hybrid approach basically incorporates Accident Analyse Mapping (AcciMap) and Analytical Network Process (ANP) methods to analyse causes of marine accidents analytically. Whilst AcciMap analyses marine accident causes schematically, the \{ANP\} technique weights them analytically which can be obtained from the synthesised supermatrix. The proposed hybrid approach is demonstrated with a real-case grounding incident at sea. Thus, prominent accident causes are revealed and necessary preventive measures are proposed in advance. Consequently, the study is expected to contribute maritime safety as well as prevent grounding accidents at sea by encouraging maritime safety engineers and ship operators. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper presents an approach to quantify human error probability in the gas inerting operation of crude oil tankers since it is one of the most critical processes on-board ships. The maritime regulatory bodies require the application of the use of inert gas on newly built tankers, and most existing tankers over 20,000 dwt, since the gas inerting operation prevents fire and chemical reaction inside the cargo tanks. Despite its operational benefits, it may cause oxygen deficiency inside the tanks and damage human health as well as the marine environment. Therefore, it is quite significant for marine safety practitioners to predict human error probability (HEP) during the gas inerting operation. Unlike conventional \{HEP\} assessment methods, this paper contains a quantitative approach to systematically predict human error for designated tasks and ascertain the desired safety control level in crude oil tanker ships. To achieve this goal, a quantification of human error probability approach is proposed. In view of the findings, human error reduction measures are recommended. As a result, the paper is expected to contribute to the improvement of maritime safety, protection of the environment, and the reduction of loss of life on-board crude oil tankers. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART) is a well-known approach for performing critical operations in safety analysis. It has various applications in many different disciplines such as nuclear energy, railway transportation, aviation and healthcare services. In addition to identifying human error categories, determining and weighting of error-producing conditions (EPCs) is the key aspect of human reliability quantification. Although \{EPC\} values are defined specifically for some disciplines, for the maritime industry these values have not been derived yet in terms of ship operational management. The aim of this paper is to produce marine specific \{EPC\} values (m-EPCs) in accordance with an advanced methodological framework, including accident causation, weighting, decision-making consensus, and statistical validation. For these purposes, a multi-dimensional approach involving Majority Rule, HEART, HFACS, AHP, and validation techniques has been utilised. Finally, a comparison between existing \{EPC\} values (i.e. for the nuclear industry) and m-EPCs is also provided to clarify industrial safety perspectives. Furthermore, this research encourages maritime safety professionals and practitioners to perform human error predictions for various critical shipboard operations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The concept of reducing risk As Low As Reasonably Practicable (ALARP) as presented by the \{UK\} Health and Safety Executive for the purpose of discharging its decision-taking responsibilities and the principle of balancing cost and benefits through monetary Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) which is used more widely in health and safety decision-making seem to occupy the extremes of the decision making spectrum. \{ALARP\} seems on the qualitative, holistic, principles based side whereas \{CBA\} seems on the quantitative, limited, precisely defined side. These characteristics expose both principles to criticism. Application of the \{ALARP\} concept may to lead to different decisions in similar contexts resulting in uncertainty and unpredictability in decision making. \{CBA\} leads to decisions in which only money counts and all that cannot be expressed in money or is perceived of no monetary value is neglected. In this paper this issue is explored in more depth, and it is concluded that they are part of the general decision making process. The nature of the relevant safety laws and how they are applied frame the application of these concepts. If the level of acceptable risk is not explicitly set by law, the risk level resulting from compliance to the regulations is just as accidental as the Value of a Statistical Life (VOSL) found from ex post evaluations of decisions. ALARP, \{QRA\} and \{CBA\} are part of the grander scheme of making decisions. Throughout, the focus is on the principle rather than the practices of \{ALARP\} and \{CBA\} in reducing risk. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The \{ATM\} system is currently undergoing various fundamental changes to improve air travel performance. A key change is the transition from a mainly reactive and tactical system to a significantly more predictive and strategic system. This is encapsulated in the concept of 4D trajectory based operations, currently being developed in Europe and the \{USA\} through the Single European Sky (SES)/Single European Sky \{ATM\} Research (SESAR) and the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGEN) respectively. At the core of this transition, is the need for improved situational awareness, shared between relevant stakeholders. The Automatic Dependent Surveillance Broadcast (ADS-B) system is a key enabler of this concept, targeted at distributing real-time positioning and navigation information to stakeholders. Therefore, the safety and credibility of the ADS-B system to support various ground and airborne applications are key, and need to be assessed and validated. This paper reviews existing safety assessment methods, identifies key limitations and proposes a novel, comprehensive and rigorous safety assessment framework for the ADS-B system. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The gas leak incidents that occurred in Al-Ahmadi, Kuwait, were considered to be unprecedented phenomena worldwide. Three gas explosions occurred between January 2010 and November 2010: two occurred at different houses that were connected to the Kuwait Oil Company natural gas network in north Al-Ahmadi, and one occurred at a house in south Al-Ahmadi that was not connected to the network. These explosion incidents triggered an immediate investigation. The fault tree analysis was used to identify the type and the source of the leaking gas and to determine how the leaking gas reached the surface. Four different source hypotheses were investigated: leaks from the natural gas network, leaks from the sewer network, leaks from wells and boreholes in and around the town of Al-Ahmadi, and leaks from underground geological formations. The study concluded that the leaking gas in the Al-Ahmadi incidents was natural gas and of geological origin. The natural gas gradually migrated from deep hydrocarbon reservoirs upwards through cap-rock fractures. The gas collected in the Dammam formation and soil near the surface and then leaked into the air. The analysis and the results of this investigation can serve as a useful reference if any similar gas leak incidents happen elsewhere. },

More than 70% of the accident resulted in loss of containment leading to spills, fires and explosions. 81% of the accidents resulted in either injuries, fatalities or both. Most of the 972 accidents with fatalities recorded 1–5 fatalities with occurrence frequency of 0.89. The analysis ranks geographical regions (states) in order of accident consequences and frequencies to enhance regulatory distribution. About 7 million \{USD\} was estimated as the average cost per accident. Estimated costs are significant and should motivate improved policy design. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Railway risk assessment is a hierarchical process where risk information obtained at lower levels may be used for risk assessment at higher levels. Fuzzy analytical hierarchy process (FAHP) is widely used in risk decision making process to solve imprecise hierarchical problems where the risk data are incomplete or there is a high level of uncertainty involved in the risk data, particularly, in the process of railway safety and risk decision making. However, the application of \{FAHP\} in risk decision making the risk analysts often face the circumstances where a large number of pairwise comparison matrices have to be established by expert knowledge and engineering judgements. There may be a lack of confidence that all comparisons associated with a railway system are completely justified in a rigorous way. This is particularly true when a complex railway system needs to be analysed or when subjective judgements should be involved. This paper presents a modified \{FAHP\} approach that employs fuzzy multiplicative consistency method for the establishment of pairwise comparison matrices in risk decision making analysis. The use of the proposed method yields a higher level of confidence that all of comparisons associated with the system are justified. In the meanwhile, the workload in determining the consistency of the judgements can be reduced significantly. A case example is used to demonstrate the proposed methodology. The results indicate that by using the proposed method, risks associated with a railway system can be assessed effectively and efficiently, and more reliable and accurate results can be obtained. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Learning from patient safety incidents is difficult; information is often incomplete, and it is not clear which incidents are preventable or which intervention strategies are optimal. Effective group processes are vital for learning but few studies in healthcare have examined in depth the processes involved and whether they are effective. The aims of this study were to identify factors that facilitated and hindered the process of analysing incidents in teams and to develop and apply a framework of indicators of effective analytic processes. Incident review meetings in acute care and mental health care were observed. Full field notes were analysed thematically. A framework of process measures was developed and used to rate each meeting using the field notes. Reliability was analysed. Factors hindering analysis were lack of organisational support, high workload and a managerial, autocratic leadership style. Facilitating factors were participatory interactions and strong safety leadership. Process measures showed deficits in critiquing the causes of incidents, seeking further information, critiquing potential solutions and solving problems that crossed organisational boundaries, supporting observational data on the importance of effective leadership. Organisational legitimacy, administrative support, training, tools for incident analysis, effective well trained leaders who empower the team and sufficient resources to manage the high workload were all identified in this study as necessary changes to improve learning. Future studies could develop and validate the proposed framework of process indicators to provide a tool for teams to use as an aid to improve the analysis of incidents. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Over the past several decades, the number of disasters around the world has been amplified. Moreover, the impacts of disasters on communities have attracted extra attentions, requiring efficient measures of disaster management. Similarly, safety problems of bridges have become public topics since bridges represent essential parts of highway infrastructure that have been exposed to multiple hazards during their life cycle. In this paper, a novel framework of disaster risk assessment is proposed, by combining Fuzzy Analytical Hierarchy Process (FAHP) with fuzzy knowledge representation and fuzzy logic techniques into a single integrated approach. A survey about collapsed bridges in the past few decades has been conducted. From this investigation the potential hazards have been identified. The \{FAHP\} approach is applied to ranking risk factors since it is more systematic, accurate and effective than traditional AHP. Risk indicators, the probability of occurrence, the impacts of disasters and disaster consequences are analyzed from expert opinions. The bridge risk is computed by implementing fuzzy logic tools on the risk factors and their parameters. The proposed method is practical and efficient for a quick and reliable multi-hazards risk analysis and assessment of bridges. Based on the level of disaster risks to which the bridge is exposed, an appropriate bridge safety management plan is required to reduce or prevent the effects of the disasters. A case study is examined for a bridge in Tianjin, People’s Republic of China. The results illustrate the applicability of the proposed risk assessment method of bridges under multiple hazards. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper aims at defining a set of indicators to be applied in port areas on the topics of Occupational Health, Safety, Security (OHSS) and Environment. The techniques used to identify and select the \{OHSS\} indicators involved two different approaches: (i) a bottom-up method, where an extended and in-depth analysis was performed in order to assess the current indicators applied by ports and, (ii) a top-down approach, mainly based on legislation and regulations as well as the feedback from stakeholders of the port and shipping industry. The bottom-up approach analysed a total number of 526 ports, allowing the identification of the most frequent indicators used by them. The top-down approach collected valuable opinions and suggestions from the port community members. A consensus between the results obtained in the two approaches was reached in order to provide ports with the most adequate and implementable indicators. The Environmental Performance Indicators (EPIs) have been selected based on the results of previous research projects plus further discussions with port stakeholders. The information provided in this paper can be considered as a preliminary attempt to promote port performance measurement in these four sensitive fields. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Acts of interference against facilities of the process industry might result in severe consequences in case of a successful attack (major explosions, fires, toxic dispersions or environmental contamination). Although protection measures are usually in place to resist intrusion and process industry sites are mostly well equipped to meet emergencies, the security of industrial sites, and in particular of chemical and petro-chemical facilities, has become a matter of increasing concern in recent years. In the present study, a semi-quantitative methodology for the assessment of industrial facilities attractiveness with respect to malicious acts of interference was presented. The methodology considers two main aspects as targeting incentives. The first is related to the plant hazard potential, i.e. the potential of causing severe damage to population in case of successful attack leading to a major accident in the facility. The second aspect is the perceived value that a target may have for a specific threat. A set of relevant specification elements influencing the targeting logic were identified, considering socio-political and strategic elements, and scoring criteria were established to estimate the attractiveness increase due to the perceived value of the target to the threat. A set of case studies, drawn on the features of existing installations, was used to exemplify the procedure for attractiveness assessment. The methodology demonstrated the importance of considering both technical and socio-political aspects, as well as ideological and strategic incentives to an attack, for a holistic determination of plant attractiveness. },

This project is assigned to model risk and consequence assessment for some aspects of blowout. The consequences should be formulated but require some adjustment. Proper Delphi group for risk assessment is made to localized risk factors. As there is uncertainty during data collection, the fuzzy approach is used. Finally, prioritizing the assets according to their criticality demonstrate significance of the risk. In the case study, the blowout in onshore Iranian drilling industry is studied. The results show that the risk of blowouts according to the reason of shallow gas in exploration well is the highest. Human failure, attack, natural event, lost circulation in development well and human failure in workover well, are another risks for Iranian drilling industry, respectively. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractObjective The process of understanding the causes of adverse events associated with complex engineered systems can be time consuming and expensive. It often requires substantial human and physical resources ranging from a few engineers up to multiple teams of domain specialists from collaborating organisations. The research presented in this article aims to provide more effective support to the analysts involved in root cause analysis (RCA) by exploring the combined application of the Issue Based Information System (IBIS) and the Function Analysis Diagram (FAD) methods. The first method (IBIS) introduces the concept of argument-based rationale for explicit justification of the nodes of a cause–effect chain as well as of redesign decisions, while the second method (FAD) introduces the notion of structure-dependent functional modelling of complex systems in normal and failure states. Method Causation data from publicly available technical reports of the Space Shuttle Challenger disaster was reverse-engineered using a root cause analysis approach based on the \{IBIS\} and \{FAD\} notations. \{IBIS\} and \{FAD\} were implemented using a free and open source software tool known as designVUE. The approach was evaluated by comparing it to a method for root cause analysis widely used in industry and assessing how it satisfies generic requirements for root cause analysis. Results The results show that the proposed IBIS-FAD approach provides a rich description of the causes for an accident presented in a manner that facilitates information access and understanding. The \{IBIS\} notation allowed for explicit modelling of the reasons supporting or refuting failure hypotheses along with evidence. The \{FAD\} notation provided a clear and concise method to visualise the complex set of non-linear interactions leading to the failure of a system by annotating graphical schematics of the design with the functions exchanged between its components. Finally, the results show that the approach supports the capture and justification of redesign decisions and ties them to initiating problems in a way that promotes the prevention of accident re-occurrence. Conclusions Argument-based rationale with \{IBIS\} and FAD-style functional modelling are powerful concepts to extend the tool set available to support the root cause analysis process. The approach proposed in this article provides a unique tool that would be of value to academics, practitioners, and regulators concerned with root cause analysis and opportunities to improve the process of understanding adverse events. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract U.S. dairy workers suffer occupational injuries and illnesses at rates higher than the national average. Occupational health and safety management systems (OHSMS) have been proposed as a way to reduce injuries and illnesses for businesses of all types and sizes. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) On-Site Consultation Service provides assistance establishing an \{OHSMS\} to U.S. businesses. As part of this service, the consultants determine the level of \{OHSMS\} programming using the Safety and Health Program Assessment Worksheet (Revised \{OSHA\} Form 33). A total of 167 dairy industry records were obtained from OSHA. Forty-five of those records had both injury rate and \{OHSMS\} data. Using these records, a Spearman Rank-Order correlation was used to determine the strength and significance of the associations between prior injury rates and \{OSHA\} measured \{OHSMS\} programming level for dairy operations. Additional analyses were conducted to examine potential relationships between workforce size, injury rates, and \{OHSMS\} programming levels. There was a negative correlation between \{OHSMS\} programming level and injury rates, both for the overall \{OHSMS\} and by \{OHSMS\} component. Management Leadership was the \{OHSMS\} component most strongly associated with lower injury and illness rates. \{OHSMS\} interventions, as part of a comprehensive risk management approach for the U.S. dairy industry, may be warranted to help reduce the unacceptable number of injury and illnesses in the U.S. dairy industry. Further research is needed to determine if similar relationships between \{OHSMS\} programming and injury rates occur in other industries. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The construction industry remains one of the most dangerous industries in the world accounting for a high percentage of work-related injuries and fatalities despite the establishment and implementation of safety programs in several developed countries. In developing countries where safety and health programs are still at their infancy or lack proper implementation, the situation is more critical. Lebanon, a small developing country in the Middle East region, has been witnessing a substantial growth in its construction market. However, achieving a safe work environment has been an ongoing challenge. This study aims at assessing current safety practices in the Lebanese construction industry through conducting one-to-one interviews with the different parties concerned including contractors, consultants, owners, insurance companies and governmental authorities. The study revealed the existence of construction labor safety law but the absence of its enforcement, the initiation of safety programs but the lack of any monitoring or follow-up, and a lack of safety education and commitment from all parties involved. The paper concludes with highlighting potential venues for enhancing safety awareness and adoption in Lebanon, which may be of insight to other developing countries in the region. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractProblem In spite of recent efforts to improve occupational health and safety, many occupational accidents result in serious injury and death every year. Continued efforts are therefore necessary to improve current safety initiatives and reduce the frequency and severity of these incidents. To identify workplace hazards, many safety surveillance techniques have been used, including severity metrics to determine the significance of an accident. These techniques involve risk assessment to identify potential hazards and the expected severity of injuries which may result from these hazards, usually based on the severity of similar past injuries. However, these severity metrics do not consider important employee and workplace risk factors, such as age, gender, and weather, which may have significant impacts on accident severity. Method A new severity scoring system is introduced which considers multiple injury severity factors, and is used as part of a novel three-dimensional risk assessment matrix which includes an incident’s severity, frequency, and preventability. A case study using the proposed methodology with real data is presented. Discussion The consideration of additional severity factors improves risk assessment and the estimation of injury severity. A three dimensional risk assessment matrix allows for the analysis of an incident’s degree of preventability, frequency, and severity all at once. Practical Applications This study demonstrates that organizations, industries, and regulatory bodies can improve workplace safety surveillance tools by incorporating this new severity metric in a three-dimensional risk assessment matrix. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Both microscopic and mesoscopic models use Helbing’s movement model for estimating the characteristics of an evacuation. Because Helbing’s movement model does not consider the effect of smoke, the influence of smoke on walking speed and the toxic gas effect of the combustion gas were used for applying the smoke effect on human behavior. However, these models cannot consider the psychological pressure on evacuees when the evacuees are confronted with the smoke or move through the smoke. Therefore, we developed a smoke effect model for representing the psychological pressure experienced when the evacuees are confronted with smoke or they move through the smoke. This developed smoke effect model is applied on FDS+Evac which can simulate the fire and evacuation simultaneously. We then analyzed the characteristics of evacuation such as evacuation time, walking speed, and direction, and the psychological pressure from smoke with applying the new smoke effect model. As a result of analysis, when the human–smoke interaction force is additionally applied, the characteristics of evacuation are more reliable than the case of considering the smoke effects on the walking speed and the life or death of evacuees only. However, additional studies for a more reliable psychological factor of the evacuees are required for improving the reality of the modified movement model. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Accident modeling methodologies in literature such as the System Hazard Identification, Prediction and Prevention (SHIPP) consider accident precursors and the associated five engineering safety barriers to assess the likelihood of accident occurrence with the help of fault and event trees to model the cause-consequence relationship between the failure of safety barriers and potential adverse events and design preventive, controlling and mitigating measures for improving the industrial process safety. In the \{SHIPP\} method, a restrictive assumption is used that the severity of the adverse events progresses only through sequential failures of the five safety barriers considered. In the proposed methodology, shortcomings of the existing accident model are improved in the following ways. Firstly, the above mentioned restrictive sequential progression assumption is mitigated in the \{SHIPP\} methodology by allowing non-sequential failure of safety barriers to cause adverse events in any order. Secondly, in the prediction of posterior probabilities of adverse events for real time industrial data, an important mechanical safety barrier ‘Damage Control Emergency Management Barrier’ has been included. Further, posterior probabilities of the occurrence of the adverse events are calculated using a Bayesian network (BN) approach. The utility of this approach is tested and demonstrated with the data from a liquefied natural gas (LNG) process facility. The method allows for continual updating of occurrence probabilities for adverse events and failure probabilities of safety barriers for successive real time data from industry. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Historically, male workers have comprised a large proportion of occupational fatalities in the US. A common explanation for this has been that men are overrepresented in more physically hazardous occupations. Yet another potential explanation is that prescribed gender roles and norms contribute to higher rates of male worker fatalities compared with female workers. The purpose of this study was to test the assumption of the overrepresentation explanation, first, by testing the degree to which overrepresentation adequately accounts for men and women’s differing fatality frequencies across various occupations, and second, by exploring gendered worker, occupation, and organizational attributes which may explain variance in the severity of men’s fatality disparity between occupational titles. We used data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and Occupational Information Network (O∗NET). Results indicate that more than 25% of the total occupational fatalities in 2012 occurred outside of what would be expected for equivalent fatality ratios for men and women working in the same occupation. Further, gendered job and worker characteristics significantly predicted variance in men’s relative risk for workplace fatalities across occupations (these characteristics, combined with sex representation, explained 10% of the total variance in men’s relative fatality risk). The results suggest that men may be at increased risk for occupational fatalities when compared to women in the same occupations, and advocate for investigating the role of gender for future research on injury and fatality discrepancies between male and female workers. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Earthquake safety paradigms in urban scenarios can be represented by the following: buildings response to ground shaking; possibility to evacuate urban areas; rescuers’ assistance to evacuating pedestrians after reaching assembly points in the urban fabric. The first element is widely investigated and involves studies on buildings vulnerability and site hazard. Last two issues are strongly influenced by urban scenarios modifications due to the earthquake and human behaviours during both event and evacuation. Consequently, understanding how people behave in similar conditions becomes an essential issue in order to properly evaluate the urban risk assessment, efficiently organize evacuation procedures and plan interventions (on critical buildings, infrastructures). Hence, this paper firstly offers an overview of current literature on human behaviour in earthquake so far as urban scenario safety is concerned. Critical factors that determine individuals’ response performances focus on human behaviours and environmental modifications due to the earthquake. The study underlines how some of the assumptions about the existing paradigms seem to be not consistent with the knowledge set out in the literature: individuals’ behaviours are generally neglected while proposing risk-reduction strategies (management, interventions on buildings), and these strategies are supposed to directly induce correct emergency behaviours on people. On the contrary, a successful approach should combine traditional evaluations with innovative analyses on human behaviours and man–environment interactions in earthquake conditions: hence, this paper finally suggests a “behavioural design” approach. Following fire safety engineering criteria, simulation models would be used for evaluating the exposure parameter and check operative strategies for interferences reduction in emergency conditions. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Earthquake risk assessment at urban scale is actually based on site hazard, buildings vulnerability and exposition, but does not consider human behaviours during both the event and the evacuation. Nevertheless, human interactions in such conditions become one of the most influencing element for inhabitants safety. Hence, an important issue is understanding how people interact with other individuals and with the environment modified by the earthquake. The development of evacuation software in earthquake conditions needs investigations about these aspects. In fact, actual data about earthquake evacuation behaviours are very poor. This work starts from this request and proposes an innovative database for earthquake evacuation models according to literature suggestions. A wide number of videotapes concerning real events from all over the World is analysed in order to provide human behaviours and motion quantities, and to integrate previous results. The database firstly includes the step-by-step evacuation behaviours that are activated during the process. Secondly, motion quantities (speed, acceleration, and distance from obstacles) are provided. The analysis of real emergency conditions evidences particular phenomena. Main results demonstrate how people prefer moving with an average speed of about 2.3–3 m/s. Finally, fundamental diagrams of pedestrians’ dynamics in earthquake emergency conditions show how, density values being equals, speeds and flows are higher than previous studies (in particular: fire evacuation and evacuation drill). These data can be used as input parameters for defining and developing new evacuation models, but also for existent models validation. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract As is the case for many innovative devices that require a novel user-technology interaction, the question of future consumer acceptance is central for the correct utilization of Advanced Driver Assistance Systems (ADAS). But since acceptance can be determined only after the direct use of the device, information that aims to promote its use should focus on improving initial acceptability before use. Acceptability is the attitude toward a new device before its use, and it can be influenced by information gathered about the device. The aim of the present work is to explore the influence of the quality of information about the device on the acceptability of ADAS. In particular, the paper explores how information about limitations and levels of automation of a advanced collision warning system (CWS) affects initial acceptability of naïve potential future buyers of cars equipped with Advanced Driver Assistance Systems. A total of 527 novice drivers (both male and female) rated a \{CWS\} presented as either fully automated with auto-brake or partially-automated and either with or without explicit mention of its use applicability and limitations. Results show that the quantity and quality of information on device-specific features can systematically change the initial acceptability of the safety device. Pleasantness of use and perceived benefits for safety were found to be the most important factors for the novice drivers. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Management of health and safety in micro-firms (&lt;10 employees) is a critical issue due to their lack of resources and the limited – in certain cases – knowledge on the subject. It is also an under-researched area in the international safety literature. The present paper is based on a Nationwide Survey with the cooperation of the relevant health and safety authority among micro-firms in several economic sectors. Micro-firms comprise a major percentage of business firms in a small economy like Cyprus. The survey involved the workers and the owners/managers of the firms, but also obtained information for compliance and safety performance of the particular firms from safety inspectors. The present research approach overcomes potential problems of common method bias when all data are obtained from the same group of respondents. The main purpose of this survey is to explore the organizational determinants of safety performance at the workplace in micro-firms. The paper presents only the results related to the perceptions of owners/managers and safety inspectors. Information was collected on demographic characteristics of firms and major influencing factors of safety performance such as employee participation in safety decisions, worker willingness to use personal protection measures, and safety training. The analysis of data has produced some interesting results showing the relationship between safety policy and good practices on the one hand and safety performance on the other, even in micro-firms. The safety performance measure, an index comprising several safety performance aspects assessed by the health and safety inspectors, has a positive and statistically significant correlation with the existence of safety policy in a firm, as stated by the owners/managers of firms. It has also a positive and statistically significant association with the written risk assessment of new equipment and the perceived employee willingness to use \{PPE\} (personal protection equipment). },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Many serious accidents related to work in confined spaces still occur. Despite all the regulatory and standard-setting efforts that have been made, organizations seem to have difficulties with risk assessment for interventions in confined spaces. Risk identification and estimation were not carried out in most of fatal accidents. This paper proposes a 5 step risk assessment tool for confined spaces based on risk management standards. The tool was tested by 22 experts in managing entries in confined spaces, including experts during 10 visits in different organizations. Step 1 consists of a questionnaire to describe the configuration of the selected confined space, its environment and the work situations. The answers generate predefined types of risk such as mechanical, atmospheric, falling, chemical, and biological. Step 2 describes the components of risks (i.e., hazards, hazardous activity, hazardous event, harm). Step 3 estimates risk using adapted risk parameters and matrix. Step 4 categorizes the intervention by class and level of risk. Step 5 is a feedback loop for estimating residual risks after risk reduction measures have been taken. This tool enables to (i) carry out comprehensive risk identification by analyzing all the risk factors during an intervention in a confined space, (ii) categorize interventions and rescue conditions by using specific criteria, (iii) determine if two situations are indeed identical in terms of risks, (iv) decide if intervention planned meets the permit required confined spaces definition, (v) evaluate if external rescue is feasible, and (iv) decide if the residual risks are acceptable. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The aim of this study was to examine how organizations in Quebec manage risks associated with confined space interventions. Fatal work accidents that occurred in confined spaces in Quebec between 1998 and 2011 were therefore studied using the database of the provincial workers’ compensation board. Thirty-two accident investigation reports involving 40 fatalities were obtained for the target period. The risk factors studied were the time of year, type of accident, and management and design problems. The risk management practices of 15 Quebec organizations were also analyzed through semi-structured interviews and observation of confined space interventions. Organizations with different profiles were chosen to cover a wide range of confined spaces and work situations. With respect to the regulatory in force in Quebec and based on the Canadian standard on the management of work in confined spaces, the organizations visited neglected the following points, in terms of both prescribed directives and actual practices: (i) management of subcontractors, (ii) auditing how risk reduction means are used, and (iii) integration of prevention through design. The lack of guidelines limited the real effectiveness of measures pertaining to training, rescue, use of certain control measures, and the preparation of entry permits. Given the complexity and diversity of the work involved in the issuance of permits, uncertainties during their preparation can lead to poor risk assessment and eventually to inadequate risk reduction measures. This article therefore proposes an entry permit consolidating all the information needed to prepare for entry, as well as recommendations regarding the aforementioned challenges. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The 2001 \{HSE\} regulations for the Norwegian petroleum sector include a paragraph requiring the promotion of a sound health, safety and environment (HSE) culture. This paper presents an examination of the function of the ‘culture’ concept in communications from the regulatory authorities to the industry. We discuss implications for organisational and interorganisational learning for safety. The regulatory authorities use ‘HSE culture’ in different ways depending on the document. No explicit definition of \{HSE\} culture is given in the regulations or the guidelines, whereas several diverging definitions are mentioned in an information pamphlet. In accident investigation reports, the HSE-culture concept has typically been used to characterise organisations with numerous violations of the \{HSE\} regulations or internal procedures. The concept has also been used to devise simplistic and possibly tautological explanations for frequent rule violations and to argue that numerous rule violations constituted a violation of the regulatory requirement to promote a sound \{HSE\} culture. The plasticity of the ‘HSE-culture’ concept proved to be a two-edged sword. By introducing the HSE-culture concept in the framework regulation, the regulatory authorities explored an unconventional approach to \{HSE\} regulation. The ‘HSE-culture’ concept legitimated a very broad range of \{HSE\} approaches in regulated companies, some of which were unexpected by the regulatory authorities. In accident investigations, the use of the ‘HSE-culture’ concept in an explanatory capacity might lead to the premature closure of a search for the causes of an undesired behaviour or decision. The use of the term ‘poor \{HSE\} culture’ to explain or characterise extensive non-compliance in the investigation reports may have stimulated the regulated companies to prioritise \{HSE\} strategies and measures to enforce compliance. },

A 75-question survey was used to evaluate seven psychosocial variables: cognitive load, temporal autonomy, job description, supervision-participation, role definition, worker interest, and personal relationships. A total of 548 workers were evaluated. Also, five qualitative characteristics (of workers) were identified: sex, age, greenhouse type, nationality, and crop type. None of the variables were associated with high psychosocial risk. Thus, the psychosocial health risks encountered by Almería-type greenhouse workers are acceptable, although optimisations over the mid and long term are necessary. },

Firstly, 16 videos were used in the pre-test session in its short version, cut to black just before the hazard appearance. The What Happens Next Assessment (at the pre-test stage) generates expectations about the outcome of the traffic situation. Then, the training (8 min in length) uses the complete version of the same 16 videos, revealing the hazards unfolding. It involves listening to a voice with relevant information about where to allocate attention in the complex driving scene in order to recognise and anticipate the hazard successfully. A total of 121 participants were included in this study. The sample consisted of learner, novice and experienced drivers, including re-offender and non-offender drivers. The participants were divided into 2 groups: a trained and an untrained group. Two assessment times were used: pre-test (16 videos) and post-test sessions (another 16 videos). The test presented a high internal consistency (Alpha = 0.875). This training shows significant positive effects for all types and groups of participants. No significant differences were found between the non-offender and the offender groups. Performance in gradual-onset hazard events can be improved after training but also by practice; however this training is essential and especially beneficial for training the ability to detect hazards that appear abruptly (which seems to be difficult to improve just by practice). },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Risk management in warehouses is a key issue to guarantee security all along the global supply chains. However, from a balanced approach including at the same time a solid theoretical background and practical processes of implementation, our comprehensive literature and field practices review proved that most of current methods to manage warehouses still do not take into account the risk level classification of stock keeping units (SKU). Thus, the w@reRISK method to analyze the security risk of \{SKU\} stocked in a warehouse is here exposed. Since risk analysis involves not only factual data, but also perceptions, this paper proposes a hybrid method based on the \{ABC\} classification of \{SKU\} as well as a \{XYZ\} variability system analysis, but also incorporates the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) to ponder subjective values which are part of risk. The method includes a security risk level classification of SKU, then introduces an exhaustive list of 34 factors useful to judge the risk of a \{SKU\} stocked in a warehouse for comparison purposes. An application example is included to demonstrate the use of the method. The lack of analytical frameworks with solid technical basis to secure warehouses along the global supply chains makes this paper a contribution to the body of knowledge in supply chain security, as well as a friendly-user method to practitioners. The proposed method is susceptible to become an automated informatics tool. As a conclusion, key issues for designing secure manufacturing supply chains are discussed, and future research is presented. },

The qualitative analysis results suggest that the demand aspect is more important than the supply and intermediary unit aspects, that “fit between certificates and industries” in relation to supply is the most important sub-criterion, and that “government and regulations” for the intermediary unit has the second highest weight. Finally, “level A technician for occupational safety management”, “level A technician for occupational health management” and “higher examination for industrial safety” have significant market value in occupational safety and health management. We use the hybrid \{FMCDM\} model in this study to provide help to industries, the government, examinees and other interested parties to find out the factors affecting the supply of and demand for certificates. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Situation Awareness (SA) is a widely cited and extensively reviewed concept. The context in which \{SA\} is examined herein is the complex socio-technical. Hence, the main focus is on Distributed Situation Awareness (DSA) and more precisely on the enhancement and degradation of the awareness regarding the threats and vulnerabilities that the system may possibly encounter. Specifically, by adopting the notion that safety and awareness are inherent and emergent properties of complex socio-technical systems, this paper introduces the novel concept of “risk \{SA\} provision”. It is also discussed that the risk \{SA\} provision capability is dynamic by nature. Lastly, the Überlingen mid-air collision accident is used to demonstrate that hazard analysis techniques can be employed to create a more detailed image of what constitutes the ‘ideal’ socio-technical system in terms of risk \{SA\} provision capabilities. Resting on safety science and control theory, this work suggests a list of system elements and characteristics, which enhance information flow, retrieval, and dissemination and contribute to maintaining the system in an ‘aware’ and safe state. It is also argued that since those system elements are tangible, it seems possible to found a new \{DSA\} assessment approach on the measurement of the risk \{SA\} provision capabilities of the system. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Two decades of research regarding the design and evaluation of drug-related warnings has not managed to eliminate accidents due to the misuse of medicines. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of characteristics of warning labels for drug containers and their effects on perceived hazardousness. The effects of specific warning symbols (exclamation marks, interdiction signs, skull-and-crossbones symbols, and lighting symbols), the color combinations of warning symbol/background (red/green, green/red, yellow/blue, and blue/yellow), and the frame surrounding the symbol (inverted triangle, triangle, octagon, and rhombus) on the level of perceived hazardousness were investigated. Eighty-three female and 36 male Taiwanese college students participated in the current study. Participants were asked to indicate their perception of the degree of hazardousness associated with warning stimuli presented on paper. Statistical analysis indicated that the degree of perceived hazardousness associated with the skull-and-crossbones warning symbol was greater than that for the exclamation mark, interdiction sign, and the lighting symbol. Additionally, the degree of perceived hazardousness was greater for the green symbol/red background color combination than for the other three color combinations. The frame also affected the degree of perceived hazardousness: the triangle was associated with a higher degree of perceived hazardousness than were the inverted triangle, the octagon, and the rhombus. Stimuli warning labels seem to influence users’ perceived severity of misusing the associated medicine. These results have implications for warning label design, particularly when these designs target specific medical products. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Currently, comparisons of road safety performance at a national or sub-national level are worthy of being conducted; both in order to better understand one’s own situation in regards to road safety risk, and to find a meaningful reference (best-in-class) to learn lessons in terms of action program formulation. In this respect, the composite road safety performance index, which condenses the vast amount of road safety information in a comprehensive manner to produce a broad picture of road safety, is rapidly developing and becoming increasingly popular. Mainly due to the unsatisfactory explanation of more detailed aspects of crash causation and injury prevention when considering isolated indicators such as fatality rate. To this end, a means to measure the multi-dimensional concept of road safety in a scientific and systematic manner is urgently required; specifically a performance measuring technique that can combine the multilayer safety performance indicators (SPIs) into an overall index. In this study the improved entropy TOPSIS–RSR methodology is structured to conduct the road safety risk evaluation process from an overall perspective, based on a composite Road Safety Risk Index (RSRI). Using the results of clustering analysis as a relevant reference, a given set of provinces are grouped into several specific classes based on the \{RSRI\} score for case study. The contrasts in results prove to verify the robustness of the proposed model. Furthermore, they indicate the feasibility of applying this model as a valuable tool for road safety policymakers to decision-making activities and performance evaluation that contains multi-alternative and multi-criteria. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The objective of this study is to understand the relationship between built environment factors and bicycle crashes with motor vehicles involved in Seattle. The research method employed is a Poisson lognormal random effects model using hierarchal Bayesian estimation. The Traffic Analysis Zone (TAZ) is selected as the unit of analysis to quantify the built environment factors. The assembled dataset provides a rich source of variables, including road network, street elements, traffic controls, travel demand, land use, and socio-demographics. The research questions are twofold: how are the built environment factors associated with the bicycle crashes, and are the TAZ-based bicycle crashes spatially correlated? The findings of this study are: (1) safety improvements should focus on places with more mixed land use; (2) off-arterial bicycle routes are safer than on-arterial bicycle routes; (3) TAZ-based bicycle crashes are spatially correlated; (4) \{TAZs\} with more road signals and street parking signs are likely to have more bicycle crashes; and (5) \{TAZs\} with more automobile trips have more bicycle crashes. For policy implications, the results suggest that the local authorities should lower the driving speed limits, regulate cycling and driving behaviors in areas with mixed land use, and separate bike lanes from road traffic. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Pedestrian crossing safety has attracted increased attention in recent years. However, little research has been conducted for examining the interaction between vehicles and pedestrians at uncontrolled mid-block crosswalks. In this paper, both a decision model and a motion model are developed for simulating this interaction process. Cumulative prospect theory is embedded in the evolutionary game framework for modeling the decision behaviors of drivers and pedestrians during the interactions, which can capture the phenomenon of disagreement among a pedestrian crossing group. Cellular automata-based moving rules are used to depict the motion of vehicles with consideration of the three-second rule, and a modified bidirectional pedestrian model is developed in order to consider the right-moving preference and resolve the deadlock among mixed flows. Results of calibration and validation of the proposed model are also presented. An application is designed for the purpose of illustrating the model’s capabilities. The results demonstrate that the proposed model can well replicate actual observed traffic. },

The study starts with in-depth interviews and content analysis to produce the initial questionnaire items. Exploratory factor analysis and confirmatory factor analysis are then applied to build reliable and valid measurement tools. The study results identified eight constructs to RSC: management commitment to safety, perception of recreation safety rules, fit between recreational environment and safety, safety training for recreationists, responsible managers, emergency facilities, caring, and altruistic safety behavior. Also identified were 27 measurement items to help recreation managers apply safety management practices. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Work-related stress is a significant occupational health concern. There have been a growing number of studies examining policy-level responses to work-related stress but most of them were from high income-countries. While welfare state characteristics are known to influence the formulation of health policy, their influences on policy responses concerning stress-related health risks at work have rarely been explored. This study compared selected indicators of social and employment-related welfare state characteristics of Taiwan with other countries. Policy level interventions undertaken in Taiwan were also reviewed. Findings show that social and employment conditions of Taiwan are characterized by low level of public social expenditure, low unionization rate, low level of collective bargaining power of workers, low female and old-age labor participation rates and substantially long working hours. Since the early 1990s, the government of Taiwan has undertaken various types of policy actions. However, most of the interventions are individual oriented and focus on tertiary level. In recent years the function of labor inspection has been strengthened but still limited in implementation capacity. While international experiences are informative, a comprehensive understanding of sociopolitical context of any given country is essential for developing effective policy actions toward work-related stress. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Routine access to non-segregated airspace is a key enabler for the civilian Unmanned Aircraft System (UAS) industry. Approvals for \{UAS\} operations in this airspace are contingent on the provision of a safety case, which details how the risk of a Mid-Air Collision (MAC) accident will be managed to an acceptable level. There is no accepted framework for structuring operational safety cases for \{UAS\} and this gives rise to a number of challenges to the application of the regulation by “safety target” approach. Further, a wide range of controls has been proposed for mitigating the risk, however the effectiveness of the controls is not known. A reconciliation and extension of existing causal models describing the \{MAC\} accident sequence is provided in this paper. A barrier bow tie model is developed as a means for structuring the safety case for generic \{UAS\} operations in non-segregated airspace. The model is applied to the classification of over 50 commonly used risk controls and the relationship between the control and the manner in which the reduction in \{MAC\} risk is achieved is determined. A case-study application is also presented validating the utility of the tool in the development and communication of safety cases for \{UAS\} operations in civilian airspace. },

This paper provides a description of the experimentation and an analysis of its main outcomes. The aim is to gain some insights into the benefits as well as the drawbacks connected to the use of video technology as a means to improve safety management in manufacturing companies. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of video technology at supporting the identification of the risks connected to unsafe behaviours of the workforce and critical conditions of the working environment. Video surveillance provides several benefits as opposed to in person observations, such as: non-biased and accurate accident data; in-depth analysis; observations possible not in real-time; observer not exposed to risks; undisturbed work activity; possibility of longer observation periods. The recorded videos can facilitate the identification of safe practices and the best risk management approaches as well as be used to improve training sessions. Further investigation is required to assess the effectiveness of the system in the long term. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Making decisions and managing competences in complex systems is a challenging task to accomplish. Specifically, the process industry is known for its complexity and sensitivity to critical procedures. Recent disasters like the “Deepwater Horizon” (2010, 11 fatalities), \{BP\} Texas City (2005, 15 fatalities), and \{AZF\} Toulouse (2001, 29 fatalities), clearly showed the risk to which we are all exposed. The increasing complexity of processes, due to the simultaneous escalation of automation, optimisation and intensification processes (followed to face globalisation challenges), are moving the attention to the management of abnormal situations, which are even more complex in nature and frequent. This increasing complexity, coupled with the fact that abnormal situations may lead to irreversible losses, is imposing the adoption of adequate approaches and tools that allow for better learning and properly managing abnormal situations. The paper presents a simulation-enabled, experiment-based approach that can be used to prevent and manage risk through competencies management. More specifically, the paper presents the results of the first experiment campaign performed in a Plant Simulator (PS), the first known in the process industry domain, and shows the efficacy of using Immersive Virtual Environments (IVE) both to make decisions and to train teams (not just single operators). The experiment results presented in the paper show the effectiveness of \{IVE\} to increase the competencies and train operators and managers. In addition, they explain how conveniently the data collected by means of the \{PS\} can be used for making daily decisions to better prevent and manage risks. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Differences in driving behavior due to the presence of users familiar (or unfamiliar) with the road are considered in the road and traffic engineering. However, although considered, the matter is largely unexplored: there is a lack of theoretical foundations and data on determining the impact of route familiarity on accident rates, speed choice and risk perception. On the other hand, some literature studies confirm that route familiarity is influential on driving behavior, encouraging research in this sense. This paper reports the results of an on-road test carried out on a two lane rural road in the District of Bari in the Puglia Region (Italy) over six days of testing by following this time schedule: first four tests in four consecutive days, the fifth test in the ninth day after the first test and the sixth test in the twenty-sixth day after the first test. The main aim of the experiment was to find relationships between route familiarity and speed choice. In particular, speed data were analyzed by considering the influence of road geometry and human factors. The main finding is that speed choice seems to be affected by route familiarity: speed increases with the repetition of travels on the same route. The particular schedule used for the tests allows to consider the influence of memory on the speed behavior of the test drivers. Moreover, some relationships between changes in speed over days, road geometry and drivers’ attitudes were shown. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Resource reduction and need to assure high quality levels in healthcare have induced hospitals to develop projects that report multiple performances. In order to pursue patient safety and efficiency improvements simultaneously, “lean &amp; safety” projects (L&amp;S projects) could be implemented, combining Health Lean Management (HLM) and Clinical Risk Management (CRM). This research aims to understand how L&amp;S projects can be implemented. The analyzed case is an exemplary one, as it has been triggered by who is in charge of patient safety and required firstly to reduce incidents and secondly to obtain efficiency improvements. Using an interview protocol grasped from literature, data have been collected conducting semi-structured interviews, analyzing relevant archival documentation and executing observations on the field. A new framework of analysis has been created answering the research purpose. This research represents one of the first studies that investigate characteristics of an \{HLM\} project adopted to solve \{CRM\} issues. The results suggest \{HLM\} and \{CRM\} should be considered in a new synergic methodology. First indications about how developing it are provided boosting future research. The outcomes of this research is valuable for hospital units and health organizations that need to achieve efficiency enhancement, improving patient safety at the same time. For managing clinical processes properly, hospital managers could consider the results of this research to solve their \{CRM\} problems. The emerged evidences contribute to the development of guidelines for the implementation of “L&amp;S” projects, pursuing multiple objectives and contributing to the growth of more safe and sustainable health care systems. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Just culture has been propounded as a necessary part of safety management to ensure open reporting. However, research has focused on the measurement and benefits of just culture without examination of the processes of culpability determination in organizations. An online survey asked 3136 aviation maintenance personnel from one company to judge the appropriate level of discipline in three incident scenarios. Five pieces of “mitigating” contextual information were subsequently presented per scenario and the participants given the opportunity to re-assess their response. Participants distinguished between scenarios, determining discipline in line broadly with just culture culpability principles. Most pieces of additional information resulted in lowered discipline levels. The pattern of response to the sequence of information was similar across geographical, job role and level of experience variables, but the level of initial and final discipline proposed differed. North American sites were more severe than European, engineers and managers more lenient than operational staff and experienced personnel more lenient than their juniors. The findings demonstrate that, at least in this organization, participants think about culpability broadly in line with just culture ideology, but that who gets to draw the line (Dekker, 2009) is critical. The findings are also broadly in line with the Path Model of Blame (Malle et al., 2014), though it is a descriptive model of blame which is less elaborate and nuanced than the prescriptive ones of just culture (Reason, 1997; Baines Simmons Limited, 2011). The study provides a foundation for the empirical investigation of just culture. },

However, this representation is not always supported by empirical data; i.e. the functionality can occasionally overreach the empirical support for it. The goals of this work are: (1) to provide data that adds to the understanding and quantification of vulnerable population’s evacuation performance, and (2) to provide sufficiently detailed and transparent data-sets for model configuration and validation. Data was collected during five evacuations from the same school, conducted between 2011 and 2014. Children from 4 to 16 years old were involved in these drills. Four of the evacuations were unannounced, while one was semi-announced (i.e. staff were aware that the drill would be conducted on a particular day). In addition to the initial scenario conditions (e.g. the building geometry, population, procedures employed, etc.), a number of different performance data-sets were collected: pre-evacuation times, travel speeds, route use and evacuation arrival curves. Through the provision of detailed architectural diagrams and other initial conditions and raw data/analysis describing evacuee performance it is hoped that this data-set will be used in the development of evacuation models and their application. The limitations in the data collection and analysis process are outlined allowing the modeler to identify where issues might arise and take corrective actions where possible. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Employees’ engagement in safety is assumed to be a significant contributor to safety performance within the chemical industry. The current study tested this assumption by examining the role of prosocial safety behaviors (e.g., helping others) and proactive safety behaviors (e.g., seeking change) in predicting four safety performance outcomes: micro-accidents, property damage (accidents without injury), near-miss events, and lost-time injuries. Two-wave data collected from 511 employees located in 2 Italian chemical plants revealed that prosocial safety behaviors predicted micro-accidents and property damage, and proactive safety behaviors predicted near-miss events and lost-time injuries. These results suggest that benefits can be gained from distinguishing between prosocial and proactive safety behaviors when seeking to improve safety performance. Organizations may reduce the rate of minor injuries and property damage by increasing helping among employees. However, this approach will be less effective in reducing more serious accidents or increasing near-miss event reporting. More effective in these cases is creating environments in which employees feel able to raise their suggestions and concerns about safety. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the light of the relevance of workers’ participation and initiative in improving safety in the workplace, a new measurement tool is presented to assess multiple psychological drivers (proactive motivations; future orientations) which support a proactive orientation by individuals toward safety management and accident prevention in the workplace. This validation study was developed with a survey methodology in two industrial samples (N = 327; 196) from the chemical and manufacturing sectors. The factor structure of the tool was tested with CFA’s. The analyses evidenced the goodness of a multidimensional structure, with a general superordinate dimension indicator of the overall construct of individuals’ proactive safety-role orientation. Moreover, the analysis of the nomological network of the new model showed positive correlations with both behavioral criteria (safety voice; safety initiative) and supervision antecedents (safety-specific transformational leadership) which were measured at the individual level. Finally, the external validity was positively verified by significant correlations with organizational outcomes assessed at the team level through external measures (supervisor evaluations; data archives) which were collected at team level (N = 32) in the following six months from the main survey. Theoretical and practical implications with indications for future research conclude the article. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract To reduce landing mishap risk, one of the greatest challenges is how to accurately determine whether a landing process is safe or not. This paper presents a landing safety analysis method based on a combination of support vector machine (SVM) and rough set theory (RST). In this hybrid approach, the carrier landing data are first analyzed with \{RST\} to identify parameters that are sensitive to changes in the state of landing safety. With a landing data set composed of the identified sensitive parameters, the \{SVM\} model is trained and the optimal separating hyperplane is obtained to distinguish between the two classes of landing samples (i.e., safe and hazardous), so as to establish the relationship between landing parameters and safety. 635 real landing samples of the aircraft carrier \{USS\} Enterprise (CVN 65) are used in the case study, and it is shown that the proposed method is able to identify those parameters contributing more significantly to landing safety and thus deserving more attention paid to. Furthermore, the hyperplane is used as a basis for formulating landing parameter design and control requirements, so that the landing parameters match well and safe landing is guaranteed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In discrete choice analysis, travel mode decisions are typically modeled as a function of observable attributes such as time and cost. Other relevant factors that are harder to conceptualize and measure – such as safety and security – are often omitted, producing bias. The leading modeling approach to integrating these subjective factors considers an econometric system of discrete choice with endogenous latent attributes. Whereas a full information estimator has been derived, it is still possible to find work that uses a two-stage estimator with poorer statistical properties. Furthermore, little attention has been devoted to how to forecast with the joint model. In this paper we use data on interurban trips with latent attributes accounting for safety, security, and comfort to compare the full and limited information estimators. In particular, we analyze the effect of alternative normalizations of the measurement scale of the subjective attributes not only for estimation but also for forecasting. In fact, we derive the choice probability elasticity with respect to a marginal change in a fatality index to measure the impact of safety and security on choice. We conclude that normalization does not affect statistical inference when the full information \{MLE\} is used. In contrast, the two-stage estimator is biased and produces important differences when different normalizations are used. },

A just culture sets out the conditions that legitimize managerial intervention in the sanction or restoration of individuals in the organization. In this paper we examine the manifestly important moral and safety issues that a just culture needs to consider. These include substantive justice which prescribes how regulations, rules and procedures themselves are fair and legitimate; procedural justice which sets down processes for determining rule-breaches, offers protections for the accused, and governs who should make such determinations; and restorative justice which aims to restore the status of the individual involved and heal relationships and injuries of victims and the wider community in the wake of an ethical breach. Just culture approaches need to provide such foundations for a genuinely just safety culture, to be conducive to reporting, engagement and safety improvement. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Adequate slip resistance of floor coverings is a prerequisite for safe walking. The incidence of slips and falls, however, indicates that insufficient slip resistance is a problem frequently arising in practice. Poor slip resistance can be a consequence of inadequate floor material and surface properties, or it can be caused by wear and maintenance. Various treatments and products are commercially available in order to improve or restore the slip resistance of problematic surfaces. In this study, the effectiveness and durability of different categories of anti-slip treatments for resilient floor coverings were investigated in a long-term field test. Repeated measurements of friction coefficients showed that anti-slip coatings initially improved the slip resistance before gradually losing their positive effect, typically with a half-life period of about 3 months. Safety coatings as well as slip-resistant adhesive tapes increased the slip resistance effectively and proved to be relatively durable, although being affected by significant mechanical wear. Scanning electron microscopy showed that the predominant wear mechanisms of the investigated floor coverings and anti-slip treatments are roughening of smooth surfaces, smoothing of rough surfaces, and intrusion of hard particles into polymers. The main and probably general result of our study is that all kinds of anti-slip treatments (coatings, tapes) gradually lose their positive effect due to wear during use. },

Ontology and semantic web technology offer an opportunity to enable such domain knowledge to be represented semantically. This paper attempts to take advantage of the strength of BIM, ontology and semantic web technology to establish an ontology-based methodology/framework for construction risk knowledge management in \{BIM\} environment. The risk knowledge is modelled into an ontology-based semantic network to produce a risk map, from which the interdependences between risks, risk paths can be inferred semantically. Based on the semantic retrieval mechanism, the applicable knowledge is dynamically linked to the specific objects in the \{BIM\} environment. Based on the methodology, a prototype system is developed as a tool to facilitate the construction risk knowledge management and reuse in hope of indirectly improving the construction risk analysis process. A case application is implemented to demonstrate the risk prevention through construction process/method selection, including the risk factors identification, risk paths reasoning and risk prevention plan recommendation. Finally, a questionnaire survey highlights the potential benefits and limitations on the deployment of such system. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Risk matrices are widely used in risk management. They are a regular feature in various risk management standards and guidelines and are also used as formal corporate risk acceptance criteria. It is only recently, however, that scientific publications have appeared that discuss the weaknesses of the risk matrix. The objective of this paper is to explore these weaknesses, and provide recommendations for the use and design of risk matrices. The paper reviews the few relevant publications and adds some observations of its own in order to emphasize existing recommendations and add some suggestions. The recommendations cover a range of issues, among them: the relation between coloring the risk matrix and the definition of risk and major hazard aversion; the qualitative, subjective assessment of likelihood and consequence; the scaling of the discrete likelihood and consequence categories; and the use of corporate risk matrix standards. Finally, it proposes a probability consequence diagram with continuous scales; providing, in some instances, an alternative to the risk matrix. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The construction industry accounts for a high number of accidents. Although identifying hazards prior to commencing construction is widely employed to prevent accidents, it typically fails because of insufficient safety experience. The experience helps in training novice inspectors, although extracting and describing tacit knowledge explicitly is difficult. This study created a digital building construction site, and designed a hazard-identification experiment involving four workplaces featuring obvious and unobvious hazards (e.g., falls, collapses, and electric shocks), and an eye-tracker was used to compare the search patterns of the experienced and novice workers. The results indicated that experience assisted the experienced workers in assessing both obvious (p &lt; 0.001) and unobvious hazards (p = 0.004) significantly faster than the novice workers could; however, it did not improve the accuracy with which they identified hazards, indicating that general work experience is not equivalent to safety-specific experience, and may not necessarily improve workers’ accuracy in identifying hazards. Nevertheless, the experienced workers were more confident in identifying hazards, they exhibited fewer fixations, and their scan paths for assessing hazards were more consistent. The experienced workers first assessed the high-risk targets—laborers working at heights—and subsequently assessed those working on the ground, followed by the equipment or environment. Furthermore, they typically inspected openings later than novice workers did. The search strategies identified may be incorporated into the training courses to improve the hazard awareness for novice workers. },

A novel algorithm for the optimum location of \{EMS\} is proposed to optimize service response time to the people, to fulfill the needs of victims and rescue teams in non-disaster case or after a possible disaster. Two new \{MADM\} models with different crisp and fuzzy criteria are introduced for ranking the 22 zones of Tehran city in these cases. Considered criteria for the non-disaster case are zone population, zone traffic, number of people per emergencies and number of serious accidents in each zone while considered criteria in the case of an earthquake disaster are zone population, proximity to a major fault lines and texture of regional construction. The results show that the proposed fuzzy decision making system successfully determines the best locations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Safety may be defined as an acceptable state of risk by society. In this respect, for assessing the current safety level of ships, it is necessary to quantify the risk level of the operating world fleet, thus estimate and assess the basic contributors to risk, namely the frequency of maritime accidents and the extent of their consequences. The present investigation was motivated by earlier published work of Det Norske Veritas (DNV, 2006), in which they were some alarming signals of worsening of the level of maritime safety. A justified question therefore is whether and how the level of ship safety changed thereafter. Recalling that a fundamental step of a Formal Safety Assessment of maritime assets is the investigation of relevant casualty reports and the analysis of historical data, which characterise the maritime safety performance in the studied period, the herein presented work deals with a systematic analysis of ship accidents in the last decade as a way to evaluate the current level of safety for the majority of ship subtypes present in the world merchant fleet and to conclude on the foreseeable future. The presented analysis also includes a deeper investigation about possible relationships between accident rates and ship’s age, which proved more complex than initially thought. The outcome of the present study indicates that in the last decade although the frequencies of ship accidents generally increased, the safety level of various ship types did not significantly change, as the consequences of accidents remained in average at about the same level. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In order to improve road safety, a number of strategies have been employed, ranging from safety campaigns, training and education, to changed regulations, stricter enforcement, infrastructural improvement and safer vehicles. The system of road traffic has traditionally been quite liberal, with low barriers to entry and respect for the privacy of individuals, as long as they abide by regulations. Arguably, the success of road safety work has come at the price of increased paternalism. The aim of this paper is threefold: first, to give a brief presentation of conceptualisations of paternalism, and their relevance to road safety. Second, to point out some of the influences leading to increased use of paternalistic measures in road safety work. Finally, I will try to define to what extent and in which situations overtly paternalistic measures appear to be (or are perceived to be) unacceptable to the public. },

The purpose of the present study was to examine the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the \{HFACS\} data classification process. Methods A total 125 safety professionals from a variety of industries were recruited from a series of two-day \{HFACS\} training workshops. Participants classified 95 real-world causal factors (five causal factors for each of the 19 \{HFACS\} categories) extracted from a variety of industrial accidents. Inter-rater reliability of the \{HFACS\} coding process was evaluated by comparing performance across participants immediately following training and intra-rater reliability was evaluated by having the same participants repeat the coding process following a two-week delay. Results Krippendorff’s Alpha was used to evaluate the reliability of the coding process across the various \{HFACS\} levels and categories. Results revealed the \{HFACS\} taxonomy to be reliable in terms of inter- and intra-rater reliability, with the latter producing slightly higher Alpha values. Conclusion Results support the inter- and intra-rater reliability of the \{HFACS\} framework but also reveal additional opportunities for improving \{HFACS\} training and implementation. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Learning from accidents contributes to improvement of safety and prevention of unwanted events. How much we can learn depends on how deeply we analyze the accident phenomenon. Traditional causal analysis tools have limitations when analyzing the dynamic complexity of major incidents from a linear cause and effect perspective. By contrast, systems thinking is an approach of “seeing the forest for the trees” which emphasizes the circular nature of complex systems and can create a clearer picture of the dynamic systematic structures which have contributed to the occurrence of a major incident. The “7.23” Yong-Tai-Wen railway accident is considered to be the most serious railway accident in Chinese railway history and this research analyzed the accident using the systems thinking approach. From the national accident investigation report, the system elements were identified and the causal loop diagram was developed, based on the system archetype of “shifting the burden”. For the problem symptoms in the accident report, the causal loop diagram not only illustrated their symptomatic solutions, but also identified their fundamental solutions. Disclosing how an underlying systemic structure finally resulted in a major accident assists the reader to prevent such accidents by starting from fundamentals. },

Despite this fact however, a great many of the existing models either do not account for this type of behavior or model it in an inadequate manner. In this paper, a leader–follower agent-based model is proposed to interpret local social interactions and collective behavior and then use this information to mimic three particular scenarios: lining up in counter-flow, queuing, and collective mobility. To achieve this, a pedestrian agent can establish informal and transient leader–follower relationships with others while adjusting its behavioral patterns as warranted by the situation. The proposed model is calibrated to existing field data and then validated using another set of field data, where it is shown that the new model is capable of reasonably simulating social collective behavior during egress. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study aims to assess the under-reporting and misclassification of the traffic injury severity reported by the police for the first time in Portugal. The non-fatality traffic injuries classified by the police are compared with the information recorded by the hospitals using linked data. The underreporting in the police data was found to be of 29%. Therefore, a significant number of road traffic casualties admitted in the hospitals were not known by the police. Taking advantage of the linked information on accident injuries, the misclassification in the police reports is assessed considering two criteria: the length of hospital stay (LS) and the maximum abbreviated injury scale (MAIS). The latter criterion corresponds to the common definition recently established by the European Commission, which has the advantage of representing the medical conditions of the casualty. The comparison between police classification and \{LS\} indicates that a discrepancy between the police reports and the established police definition exists. On the other hand, the police classification shows a tendency to overclassify the injury severity regarding the MAIS. A remarkable proportion of severe injuries reported by the police are, in fact, slight injuries. Additionally, using univariate and multivariate analyses, factors contributing to the misclassification of casualties by the police are identified. Finally, similarly to the fatality adjustment coefficient used in Portugal and in other countries in the past, non-fatality adjustment coefficients were computed to estimate the total casualties taking into account the under-reporting and misclassification phenomena. These adjustment factors are compared with other countries. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Speed is a primary contributor to crash frequencies and increased severity with over 30% of traffic fatalities attributed to speed. Research on rational speed limits suggests that simply lowering speed limits does not necessarily result in safer roadways; thus, there is a need to revisit the process by which speed limits, which are the front lines of any speed management program, are established. Traditionally, speed studies are conducted by taking spot speed observations at varying intervals along a roadway, however it would be ideal to have speed values continuously along a roadway. The specific objective of this research effort was to compare a continuous data collection method with existing methods and develop a methodology for integrating them to improve roadway safety. In this study, a group of drivers were equipped with a smartphone application which continuously captured video, vehicle speeds, and location data. The continuous speeds were then compared to speeds captured at eight fixed points. The results identified similarities in the 85th percentile speeds observed using the various data collection methods and a case study was conducted using FHWA’s expert system, USLimits2. The results provide evidence for a successful proof of concept for mapping continuous speed data to traditional speed data collection points that may help in the speed limit setting process as well as the establishment of appropriate advisory speed zones. This research endeavor outlined a methodology which may be utilized to improve the process by which engineers determine speed limits and advisory speed zones. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Approximately one car occupant per year is killed as a result of landslides or avalanches in Norway, compared to 150–200 fatalities due to accidents. Still, protection from landslides is a major transport safety issue, possibly due to the concern and dread felt by the car-driving population travelling through landslide-prone areas. A main challenge when valuing landslide risk economically lies in distinguishing it from the standard road accident risk of having a collision or running off the road. In this paper we present an approach to the valuation of landslide risk, using a stated choice experiment where internet survey respondents were asked to choose between route alternatives that differed in terms of landslide risk, casualty risk, time use and cost. Thus, landslide risk was explicitly valued as an attribute, besides travel time and casualty risk, conveying a valuation of a feature different than the risk of fatality or injury caused by ordinary road accidents. The stated route choice data were analysed using mixed logit models. We obtained point estimates for the value of landslide risk removal per kilometre driven ranging from about \{EUR\} 0.2 to \{EUR\} 0.3. These results indicate that landslide risk was perceived as something different from casualty risk related to collisions with other road users or driving off the road. More research is warranted for developing the procedures for valuation of landslide risk before such valuations can enter as input into cost-benefit analyses of landslide-reducing measures. },

There is, therefore, a need to consider if and how these large alterations affect rail safety. The aim of the study was to explore train drivers’ experiences and perceptions of conditions affecting safety of the Swedish railway system. Narrative semi-structured interviews were performed with ten train drivers. Qualitative content analysis was used to analyze the interviews. The results were captured in two main categories: (1) Facing structural changes includes results unclarity in responsibility assignment, deteriorated tracks and insufficient safety culture and (2) facing technology development, covered safety systems such as \{ATC\} and \{ERTMS\} which were seen as high-quality safeguards with both benefits and challenges due to new technical devices. The new challenges that have entered the arena should be offset by increased coordination and by a party responsible for safety within the industry. Finally, restrictions and regulations regarding the use of the tablets and smart phones are desirable. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Chemical industry accident reports provide a wealth of information that can be used to develop lessons learned to improve safety and efficiency of operations at chemical industry facilities. The United States Chemical Safety Board (CSB) is one source of these accident reports. As a part of an investigation and causal analysis process, \{CSB\} investigators identify “Key Issues” for each chemical accident. This research evaluated trends in those Key Issues by applying two distinct analyses of these issues. The first analysis assessed the Key Issues naturalistically, as reported by the expert investigation team; however, this result was problematic, as about 2/3 of all Key Issues, as described in the chemical industry accident reports, occurred only once. In the second analysis, the Key Issues were sorted thematically to capture insights from the many single-occurrence issues. This thematic analysis, using categories drawn from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration’s (OSHA’s) Process Safety Management (PSM) guidance, allowed for a more comprehensive understanding and grouping of the issues behind the chemical accidents studied. The findings of this research identified several accident themes that can be used to develop a better understanding of chemical industry accidents and potentially improve safety and efficiency of operations at chemical facilities. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A dome is an architectural structure shaped like the hollow upper half of a sphere. Domes are widely used in subway stations to reduce the sense of oppression felt by people in underground spaces. This paper presents an analysis of the effect of domes on fire-induced smoke control in subway stations. The computational fluid dynamics method of large eddy simulation was used in the analysis. Four different grid systems were compared, and a sensitivity analysis of the model constants was performed. Different values of the Schmidt number and Prandtl number were tested, and values of 0.3 and 0.4, respectively, were adopted. The confluence, storage, and suppression effects of domes on fire-induced smoke were analyzed. The preliminary results obtained suggest that the carbon monoxide (CO) concentration in the hall of a subway station is significant lower when the fire source is located under the dome. For a subway station without a dome, there is a linear relationship between the average \{CO\} concentration and the distance from the coordinate origin. The correlation coefficient (R) for this linear relationship is 0.9957. For a subway station with a dome, there is a first-order exponential decay relationship between the average \{CO\} concentration and the distance from the coordinate origin, and the R of this relationship is 0.9988. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Disposal of end-of-life vessels in an environmentally sound and safe manner is a major challenge today. In the present study an attempt has been made to develop a three-step risk assessment method – which offers a systematic pedagogic approach for the “analysis team” comprising of production managers, safety officers, safety supervisors and the designated expert monitor to reduce risks and enhance safety at ship recycling yards. The three-step risk assessment was performed in 35 ship recycling yards through questionnaire surveys and door-to-door communication. Thus, 35 data sets from field personnel at the ship recycling yards, each data set with 8 risk indexes (4 risk indexes each, before and after implementing corrective actions) were collected. In addition, 9 data sets were collected to document the perceptions of experts. In all, a total of 44 data sets were collected and used to validate the risk assessment method. Validation of the three-step method, essentially addresses the differences (or similarities) in “perception of risk” by several health, safety and environment (HSE) managers who volunteered for the risk assessment exercise. In order to validate the risk assessment method, three validation protocols were developed. Consistency check on the data sets was also performed and it was found that the relationship was linear with the slope close to unity. The example illustrating the application of Three Step Method in identifying and minimizing risks provides clear understanding for the users of this method. Evidently, the three-step risk assessment method developed in this research appeared to give consistent results in a variety of scenarios of validation. },

Reaching this goal, different aspects of the sustainable excellence model and its indices have been introduced, and through Multiple Attribute Decision-Making (MADM) approaches, Iranian petrochemical companies were assessed and ranked. Since the results of \{MADM\} are not panacea for all decision making problems and the questionnaire self-assessment approach is not rigorous enough, different techniques have been involved for compensation. In the following, the convergence of \{MADM\} rankings has been compared. The findings signify that processes management, leadership, social environmental accountability and staff results are of relative importance in \{H3SE\} performance assessment. Moreover, Ethylene Gharb, Zagros, and Bandar Imam companies have the highest rankings. Finally, ranking sensitivity was analyzed. Since the data were collected through questionnaire self-assessment approach, the reliability of this assessment may be doubted. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Local Emergency Response Plans (LERP) must be assessed before being triggered, to ensure proper execution of missions in a crisis situation. However, there is very little research on plan assessment methods. Plan assessment has traditionally involved consideration of only two states: complete functioning, or failure. In this paper, we propose an \{LERP\} assessment method that evaluates \{LERP\} performance under multiple states of its resource degradation. Our method relies on Function-Interaction-Structure (FIS) modeling to describe interaction between resource degradation and plan failure. Our multi-state and model-based approach allows a comprehensive analysis of \{LERP\} weak points, and provides the framework for evaluating a wide range of engaged resources. Consideration of multiple states of resource degradation is needed in order to show to what extent an \{LERP\} is required. We propose to combine a Fault-Tree embedded in \{FIS\} with a Multi-State System approach. With this approach, plan evaluators can study \{LERP\} effectiveness at various levels of incomplete functioning, and can analyze the risk of resource degradation leading to functional impairment of \{LERP\} missions. The Multi-State System approach provides knowledge about the likelihood of an \{LERP\} being in multiple states of degradation on disaster day. Input data for the analysis are gathered using developed questionnaires. These are used by Emergency Response Plan makers to evaluate the probability of resource degradation states, and to develop strategies to increase the likelihood of \{LERP\} success. This paper shows how the proposed methodology, based on modeling and Multi-Level Fault-Trees, can inform the analysis of an \{LERP\} evacuation function. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Proximity detection systems are actively being marketed to the underground mining section as a way to provide enhanced information for operators of large underground machinery. To date, many of the systems are lacking the reliability and validity ratings that researchers would like to see them have. Due to this, they may not interact in a predictable way to always improve operator awareness. In fact, Burgess-Limerick (2011) noted that in many fatalities that occurred on underground machinery, the operator was aware of the location of the victim, or they were the victim themselves. This work recreates one of the accidents from that review in a computer simulation environment, models a video-based proximity detection system and then evaluates the capacity of the system to improve operator line of sight. Results demonstrate that there was only a small window of time during which the operator may have been able to see the victim’s location even with a hypothetical camera system installed. The work points to the importance that mine design and machine design have with respect to improving safety of the worker, as well as the downfalls of existing proximity detection systems that rely on video feeds mounted to the machinery. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper proposes a framework for risk analysis of maritime transportation systems, where risk analysis is understood as a tool for argumentative decision support. Uncertainty is given a more prominent role than in the current state of art in the maritime transportation application area, and various tools are presented for analyzing uncertainty. A two-stage risk description is applied. In the first stage, Bayesian Network (BN) modeling is applied for probabilistic risk quantification. The model functions as a communication and argumentation tool, serving as an aid to thinking in a qualitative evidence and assumption effect assessment. The evidence assessment is used together with a sensitivity analysis to select alternative hypotheses for the risk quantification, while the assumption effect assessment is used to convey an argumentation beyond the model. Based on this, a deliberative uncertainty judgment is made in the second risk analysis stage, which is supplemented with a global strength of evidence assessment. The framework is applied to a case study of oil spill from tanker collisions, aimed at response capacity planning and ecological risk assessment. The BN-model is a proactive and transferable tool for assessing the occurrence of various spill sizes in a sea area. While the case study uses evidence specific to the Gulf of Finland, the model and risk analysis approach can be applied to other areas. Based on evaluation criteria and tests for the risk model and risk analysis, it is found that the model is a plausible representation of tanker collision oil spill risk. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Ship collisions are rare occurrences with a potential to cause significant human, monetary and/or environmental loss. One element in preventing collision accidents is the presence of a collision alert system (CAS), providing warnings to ship crews and/or personnel in Vessel Traffic Services of the collision risk in a real-time operational environment. In risk research, there is a recent focus on foundational issues related to risk concepts, perspectives and methods for describing risk, with calls for work addressing these risk-theoretical issues in application areas. Despite several proposed applications for CAS, no frameworks covering these risk-theoretic issues have been presented. Hence, the purpose of this paper is twofold. First, a framework for maritime risk-informed \{CAS\} (RICAS) is presented, including a risk-conceptual basis, a systematic description of the risk perspective and a discussion on the intended use of the risk model. A theoretical framework for the operationalization of the construct “ship collision risk” is presented, and a method for measuring this construct is introduced. Second, the framework is applied to a case-study concerning open sea navigation. An evaluation of the proposed \{RICAS\} in comparison with earlier proposed \{CAS\} methods indicates an improved performance over these. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Risk matrices and risk diagrams are widely used tools for analyzing, assessing and visualizing risk in many industries, and are used extensively for risk management purposes. Despite their popularity and wide application, they have recently become the object of discussion and research in scientific environments, which can be seen as part of a wider focus on foundational issues in the risk analysis discipline. Identifying several serious limitations and problems with the risk matrix approach, various authors have proposed extensions, modifications and recommendations for their use. One issue which has been raised recently but has attracted relatively limited scientific attention is the consideration of uncertainty in risk diagrams, i.e. how to visually represent and communicate uncertainty. This paper first reviews the available proposals for this question. Subsequently, the strengths and weaknesses of these proposals are discussed. Finally, some new proposals are made on how to represent uncertainty in risk diagrams in practical applications. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Fall from height (FFH) is a perennial problem in the construction industry across many countries. In Singapore, construction worksites are required to develop and implement a fall prevention plan (FPP) to eliminate and mitigate the risk of fall hazards. The \{FPP\} is a document that records information such as fall prevention policy, roles and responsibilities, fall risk assessment, and emergency response. This study aims to evaluate the effectiveness of \{FPP\} in reducing the risk of \{FFH\} accidents and to identify the underlying factors influencing the success of a program-based safety intervention. A mixed method approach involving an exploratory site visit, 4 interviews, a questionnaire survey with 93 complete respondents, and content analysis of 17 \{FPP\} was conducted. In addition, an ordinal regression was conducted on the questionnaire survey data. The analyses indicate that \{FPP\} was perceived as an effective intervention because it requires clear allocation of responsibilities, increases the commitment to fall prevention and made competency requirements explicit. Nonetheless, the effectiveness of the \{FPP\} is limited by issues such as failure to implement the FPP, lack of contextualisation to site situations, lack of competency of frontline supervisors and workers, inadequate cooperation from sub-contractors and insufficient management commitment. The study provided empirical data to support insights on the underlying success factors for program-based safety interventions. The study raised concerns about the phenomenon of “paper exercise”, where documents were created to satisfy safety requirements, but do not meet the intent of management or regulators. Further research on the phenomenon was recommended. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Modeling analysis of rare events like occupational accidents from nuclear power plants are crucial to understand potential risks. India is poised for a major expansion of civil nuclear energy in the coming decades; such an analysis with this background becomes more important. With this background, this paper explores the pattern of the historical data on severity and frequency of accidents in the select nuclear power plants of India. Based on the historical trend, econometric projections have been undertaken on the estimates of fatality, severity rates within the different uncertainty limits. Results of the projection exercise seem to indicate that there is a probable likelihood of a rise in fatal accidents in nuclear power plants in the absence of incremental safety culture. Further, through a downscaled analysis of global nuclear accidents, the severity and frequency rates of accidents for the Indian nuclear power plants are estimated. Overall, appreciative of the fact that there has not been many major accidents in the past, the results however communicate there is a need to continuously step up policy interventions and safety culture to tackle fatal accidents in nuclear power plants of India. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Safe and functional nuclear industry design is a topic of growing interest due to new builds and modernization projects in the operating nuclear power plants. Provided that good design of components and systems is critical for safe operation of the plants, understanding what influences the process of learning for safety in design activities is of utmost importance. The existing literature emphasizes tensions of design activity but pays insufficient attention to the culture of design and its relation to safety and learning. This paper aims at identifying cultural features of design organizations, such as shared conceptions, assumptions, norms, beliefs, and exploring their influence on the process of shared learning for safety. Case studies were carried out in Finland and Sweden to generate insights on cultural characteristics of design in the nuclear domain. The paper indicates the importance of requirements as a media for sharing knowledge and learning in nuclear industry design projects. As the networked aspects of the design work are gradually acknowledged, the need to learn how to systematically manage the requirements and understand the big picture of the overall design project are highlighted. },

Resource allocation challenges are particularly acute in Arctic oil spill response, where the lack of infrastructure makes logistics challenging and heightens the need for comprehensive and thoughtful resource allocation models. This paper describes data challenges associated with the development of resource allocation models for dynamic network scheduling in support of Arctic oil spill response. A marine transportation traffic analysis and an Arctic resource allocation database, developed to support the resource allocation model development described, were developed using public and private information sources. This paper outlines the challenges associated with the data acquisition and analysis efforts, and provides recommendations for addressing the data challenges, which are similar to those in other complex, safety–critical resource allocation problem settings. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract New safety critical systems are about to appear in our everyday life: advanced robots able to interact with humans and perform tasks at home, in hospitals, or at work. A hazardous behavior of those systems, induced by failures or extreme environment conditions, may lead to catastrophic consequences. Well-known risk analysis methods used in other critical domains (e.g., avionics, nuclear, medical, transportation), have to be extended or adapted due to the non-deterministic behavior of those systems, evolving in unstructured environments. One major challenge is thus to develop methods that can be applied at the very beginning of the development process, to identify hazards induced by robot tasks and their interactions with humans. In this paper we present a method which is based on an adaptation of a hazard identification technique, \{HAZOP\} (Hazard Operability), coupled with a system description notation, \{UML\} (Unified Modeling Language). This systematic approach has been applied successfully in research projects, and is now applied by robot manufacturers. Some results of those studies are presented and discussed to explain the benefits and limits of our method. },

To reduce risks, it is important to change attitudes and increase knowledge about safety. Safety training have shown to establish positive attitudes towards safety among employees. The aim of current study is to analyze the effect of \{QR\} codes that link to Picture Mix \{EXposure\} (PIMEX) videos by analyzing attitudes to this safety training method and safety in student responses. Safety training videos were used in upper secondary school handicraft programs to demonstrate wood dust risks and methods to decrease exposure to wood dust. A preliminary study was conducted to investigate improvement of safety training in two schools in preparation for the main study that investigated a safety training method in three schools. In the preliminary study the \{PIMEX\} method was first used in which students were filmed while wood dust exposure was measured and subsequently displayed on a computer screen in real time. Before and after the filming, teachers, students, and researchers together analyzed wood dust risks and effective measures to reduce exposure to them. For the main study, \{QR\} codes linked to \{PIMEX\} videos were attached at wood processing machines. Subsequent interviews showed that this safety training method enables students in an early stage of their life to learn about risks and safety measures to control wood dust exposure. The new combination of methods can create awareness, change attitudes and motivation among students to work more frequently to reduce wood dust. },

Data were collected from 215 construction workers in New Zealand using a questionnaire. Eight competing models were tested using structural equation modeling (SEM). The results showed that management safety commitment was significantly related to social support and production pressure. Production pressure was identified as a critical factor that has direct and significant effects on safety motivation, safety knowledge, safety participation and safety compliance. Furthermore, social support was found to have the same paths to influence safety behavior as production pressure, except that the effect on safety participation was insignificant. Safety knowledge and safety motivation were significantly and positively related to safety participation. The integrative model suggests a combination of “a safe organization”, “safe groups” and “safe workers” strategies to reduce unsafe behavior on sites. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Fatal construction accidents are major problem in Turkish construction industry. Although new comprehensive legislation has been inured recently; level of consciousness in the industry is unsatisfactory and safety is perceived as an extra cost. Small or middle scaled residential projects have a big share in the industry and majority of the fatal accidents usually occur on such work sites. Focus of this study is small and middle-scaled residential construction sites. Drawings, technical specifications, bill of quantities of 25 concrete residential buildings with total areas that vary between 230 and 118,200 m2 in Istanbul were examined. Site visits and information gathering were performed from site engineers. This study aims to give an approach for safety cost estimation for the early stages of construction bidding phase using risk assessment activities and construction project scheduling by focusing on construction activities. Additionally, a cost analysis was performed and the results were compared and analyzed with a former project that focused on 30 concrete residential projects in Istanbul. Primavera \{P6\} was utilized for scheduling, and risk assessment was conducted using the techniques applicable for construction projects (i.e., L matrix and Fine-Kinney). Finally, activity-based techniques were used for cost estimation. The results of this study reveal that the percentage of safety cost to the total construction cost is 1.92%. Also, to comply with the current legislation and minimize risks; 0.85 \{USD\} per man-hour should be spent according to 2013 rates and safety cost per unit area was found as approximately 5.68 USD. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Complex arguments continue to be articulated regarding the theoretical foundation of health and safety management system (HSMS) performance measurement. The culmination of these efforts has begun to enhance a collective understanding. Despite this enhanced theoretical understanding, however, there are still continuing debates and little consensus. The goal of the current research effort was to empirically explore common methods to \{HSMS\} performance measurement in mining organizations. The purpose was to determine if value and insight could be added into the ongoing approaches of the best ways to engage in health and safety performance measurement. Nine site-level health and safety management professionals were provided with 133 practices corresponding to 20 \{HSMS\} elements, each fitting into the plan, do, check, act phases common to most HSMS. Participants were asked to supply detailed information as to how they (1) assess the performance of each practice in their organization, or (2) would assess each practice if it were an identified strategic imperative. Qualitative content analysis indicated that the approximately 1200 responses provided could be described and categorized into interventions, organizational performance, and worker performance. A discussion of how these categories relate to existing indicator frameworks is provided. The analysis also revealed divergence in two important measurement issues; (1) quantitative vs qualitative measurement and reporting; and (2) the primary use of objective or subjective metrics. In lieu of these findings we ultimately recommend a balanced measurement and reporting approach within the three metric categories and conclude with suggestions for future research. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Management of health and safety in micro-enterprises (less than 10 employees) is a critical issue due to the relatively high level of injuries in such firms. It is also an under-researched area in the international safety literature. The present paper is based on a nationwide survey with the cooperation of the relevant health and safety enforcement authority among micro-firms in several economic sectors. Micro-enterprises comprise a major percentage (95.4%) of business firms in a small economy like Cyprus. The survey examined the perceptions and work attitudes of workers and their relationship with safety performance of the particular firms. This paper presents the results related to the perceptions of employees. A previous paper presented the results focusing on employers. Information was collected on their demographic characteristics and major influencing factors of safety performance like employee participation in safety decisions and safety training. The safety performance measure, an index comprising several safety performance aspects was assessed by the health and safety (labour) inspectors, in order to overcome potential problems of common method bias when all data are obtained from the same group of respondents. The findings suggest that safety performance has a positive and statistically significant correlation with safety training provided by the firm. It has also a positive and statistically significant association with the safety information available to employees and with the perceived safety conditions. The effect of the participation of workers in safety decisions and their organizational commitment, although significantly correlated with safety performance as individual variables, are not statistically significant after controlling for the effect of the other variables mentioned above. The results show the important relationship between safety training and other good practices (like provision of information and improved safety conditions) on safety performance in micro-firms. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractObjectives Our objectives were four fold: (1) to provide a contemporary update on the prevalence of hazards on farms; (2) to document the safety practices of farm owner-operators; (3) to measure investments in farm safety and (4) to assess their relationship with injury within a current regulatory environment. Methods The study sample included 1218 farms that provided reports via a mailed questionnaire as part of a larger prospective cohort study. Participating farms were operated as individual family farms (56%), family corporations (26%), or formal partnerships (17%). Leading commodities produced included grain (88%) and beef or dairy cattle (42%). The median acreage was 1480 acres, with 28% operating more than 2500 acres. Analyses were descriptive and etiological and focused on the prevalence of hazards, investments in safety, safety practices and work habits, and how they related with farm injury. Results Physical conditions on farms and associated farm operator attitudes and beliefs were often inconsistent with safe work practices. Investments in farm safety and also engagement in safe farm work practices were inversely related (p &lt; 0.05) to the presence of hazards. After adjustment for confounding, these investments and practices were related to decreased risks for farm injury, but not serious farm injury. Conclusions Reliance on safety standards that are mainly voluntary continues to put some farm people at risk for injury. Yet those that do comply with obvious and known safety measures are likely to have fewer exposures to physical hazards and unsafe work practices. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The main purpose of this work consisted in comparing the risk perception of emergency survivors and firefighters regarding fires in domestic and public settings, since specific research on the perception of fire risks is scarce. The sample, recruited in the context of the BeSeCu study, comprised a total of 3446 subjects (survivors: n = 747; firefighters: n = 2699) from seven European countries: Germany, Italy, Poland, Sweden, Spain, the Czech Republic, and Turkey. Using the standardized self-report instruments BeSeCu-S (survivors) and BeSeCu-FR (firefighters), probability estimates regarding two fire-related emergency situations were gathered. The results showed that in both the survivor and firefighter sample, the estimates differed with respect to the type of fire situation: The probability of becoming a victim of a fire in a domestic setting was consistently estimated as higher than becoming a victim of a fire in a public setting, which is consistent with the ranking order of the objective risks. Furthermore, the firefighters’ probability estimates concerning the two emergency situations were generally more accurate than the survivors’ assessments, within the total sample and the country subsamples. This is mostly in accordance with research findings being in favor of the higher accuracy of expert judgments. The results of this study provide new insights concerning the risk perception of laypeople and experts, and the way different natures of experience influence the accuracy with which risks are perceived. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The construction industry has long accounted for one of the highest injury and fatality rates of any single-service industry. Within the construction industry, a promising technique is construction hazard prevention through design (CHPtD). Logically, \{CHPtD\} is only effective to the extent that construction hazards have emerged and are recognizable during the design phase. The objectives of this study were to measure: (1) the extent that construction hazards are apparent or recognizable during design; (2) the hazard recognition skill of designers; and (3) the extent to which hazard recognition skill can be improved in design through training and mnemonics. A multi-phase experiment was designed to identify 12 representative construction modules; observe the construction of these modules and conduct interviews to determine hazards present; obtain the design documents for the modules observed; and assess the ability of 17 designers to identify the hazards using only design documents. The results of the experiment indicated that approximately 25% of all hazards are latent in design and, of those hazards that are patent, the average designer hazard recognition skill was 51%. Further, the hazard recognition skill of designers with construction field experience was, on average, 45% higher than designers with no construction field experience (p = 0.02). Finally, a brief introduction to the Haddon energy mnemonic increased designer’s hazard recognition skill by an average of 27% (p = 0.001). Future research is suggested to determine the potential impact of emerging technologies on hazard recognition skill including three-dimensional printing and virtual design and construction software. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The \{US\} construction industry has long been responsible for a high injury and fatality rate. Within this dangerous industry, Hispanic workers are 45% more likely to be injured or killed than their non-Hispanic counterparts. Previous researchers have examined reasons for these disproportionate injury rates but past literature is spurious, fragmented, and incomplete. To address these limitations an in-depth study was launched to explore the perceived challenges that impact the safety of Hispanic construction workers. The primary data collection method was Photovoice, a photograph-based interview process that allows each participant to be the generator of their own data. The results of Photovoice interviews with 17 Hispanic workers in Colorado indicate that, compared with non-Hispanic workers, Hispanic workers perceive that they are: (1) susceptible to an internal pressure to complete work quickly and neglect safety based on their experiences in their home country; (2) assigned more dangerous tasks because of racism and discrimination; (3) more willing to accept dangerous work for fear of losing their jobs and ability to support extended family; (4) less likely to provide feedback to their supervisors and co-workers for fear of negative personal reactions; (5) more likely to be distracted by family issues while at work because of their strong and broad family ties; (6) more likely to ignore criticism because of machismo; (7) more likely to underreport injuries for fear of losing their jobs; and (8) less likely to ask for safety assistance when it is needed because of pride. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract When the number of evacuees exceeds a capacity of an evacuation area, people who cannot enter the evacuation area have to change in his/her destination to go another area. To simulate the change in destination, a switching action model is developed. The behavior of change in destination during evacuation will be considered as a significant factor. Previously the authors have developed a microscopic multi-agent model based on the Distinct Element Method (DEM). In this paper, the switching action algorithm is introduced into our conventional DEM-based multi-agent model so that the change in destination during evacuation can be reproduced. The new formulation of the switching action model is based on the convolution integral of two functions. Currently, the newly developed model is validated by means of sensitivity analysis in which several values of model parameter have been tested. Accordingly, appropriate switching action behavior and contact force acting on each person are monitored. The proposed model is then demonstrated on different conjectural scenarios of the evacuation process. },

Interviews with health and safety personnel, company directors and worker representatives were used to categorise the organisations according to their approaches to \{OSH\} management, using the Continuous Improvement Cycle model (Budworth and Khan, 2003). A cross-sectional survey of 2067 employees from these organisations examined the impact of company size, industrial sector and approach to \{OSH\} management on indicators of organisational performance and employee outcomes. A structured questionnaire assessed demographic characteristics, organisation and job tenure, job satisfaction, organisational commitment, intention to quit and job motivation, safety climate, self-reported absence, performance and work-related ill-health. Organisations were also asked to provide data on profit, performance, accidents and absence indices. Organisations adopting a proactive approach to \{OSH\} management reported higher profit margins and lower accident rates, however these differences were not statistically significant. Organisations classified as ‘very good’ were found to show significantly more positive safety climate perceptions across eight out of the nine safety climate dimensions. Employees in proactive organisations were significantly more committed to their organisations and showed greater job satisfaction than employees in organisations categorised as ‘yet to be fully engaged/complier’. Positive safety climate perceptions and organisational attitudes were associated with better self-reported physical and mental health. The findings add to the validation of the \{CIC\} model as an assessment and learning tool which may support the transition of organisations from reactive to proactive safety culture. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Converting an idea into a complex facility such as an offshore platform, an oil refinery or a petrochemical plant requires many individuals and groups with differing professional norms and organizational interests to contribute their effort and expertise over an extended period of time. Despite the complexity of this social system, little research has investigated the social processes in those workplaces where the physical form of these potentially hazardous facilities is determined. Based on 34 interviews plus workplace observation and document review in six organizations, this article addresses social relationships and attitudes within and around design teams, and factors that influence outcomes. Using concepts of power and conflict drawn from sociology and organizational psychology, the research findings address structural contributions to conflict between discipline engineers and project managers and the influence of discipline engineers on senior management decision making. In the design environment, primary responsibility for differing project goals is divided between discipline engineers (safety and quality) and project managers (cost and schedule). This research suggests that the best long-term safety outcomes are likely to be fostered where these groups have similar levels of power over key decisions so that competing goals can be openly discussed. An ethnographic study such as this necessarily provides data with depth, rather than breadth. Nevertheless, it has brought to the attention of the safety community some key issues regarding design team dynamics that have, to date, been largely ignored by social science researchers. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Inquiries into the causes of man-made disasters have shown repeatedly that ongoing safety of workers and the public depends on decisions made, often many years earlier, during the design stage of infrastructure or facility development. The potential for disaster represented by incompatibilities that remain undiscovered between design choices and future operating requirements is a classic example of what Turner calls ‘disaster incubation’ – where beliefs about control of hazards are at odds with actual events. This research investigates the motivations and attitudes of people working in a design office environment who determine the form of hazardous facilities such as oil refineries, petrochemical plants and pipelines. It explores particularly the issue of responsibility for public safety. This long-term goal faces serious competition for attention from short-term project priorities of integrity, cost and schedule. Linking requirements for public safety to facility integrity (as is often done in a project environment) is shown to have substantial limitations as a strategy for ensuring the best long term outcomes. As a counter to this, some senior discipline engineers were found to emphasise the real-world potential consequences of their work through use of stories and saw communication of professional values to younger staff as a key aspect of their work. The paper also touches on the perceived role of engineering standards and shows that safety design is seen to go beyond simply compliance. There has been little social science research in this important area. The paper concludes with areas in which further work would be valuable. },

Safety motivation is essential to enhancing safety behaviors among employees. The objective is to evaluate whether six different interventions including safety training increase safety motivation. A validated questionnaire was used at two metal companies, two municipal agencies, one paper mill, and one plastic company. Statistical tests were used to compare the results at the factorial and item levels. In three cases, safety motivation changed significantly at the factorial level. There was a significant difference in each intervention at the item level. The outcomes indicate that the degree of participation, the number of occasions, the primary target group, and the decision maker of the intervention affect safety motivation. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Intrusion (unauthorized stepping-into/staying-in a hazardous area), as a common type of near-miss, is the prime cause of the majority of incidents on construction sites including fall from heights, and striking against or being struck by moving objects. Accidents often occur because workers take shortcuts moving about the site without fully perceiving the potential dangers. A number of researches have been devoted to developing methods to prevent such behaviors mainly based on the theory of Behavior-Based Safety (BBS), which aims to cultivate safety behaviors among workers in accordance with safety regulations. In current \{BBS\} practice, trained observers and safety supervisors are responsible for safety behavior inspections following safety plans and operation regulations. The observation process is time-consuming and its effectiveness depends largely on the observer’s safety knowledge and experience, which often results in omissions or bias. This paper presents a reformed safety behavior modification approach by integrating a location-based technology with BBS. Firstly, a detailed background is provided, covering current intrusion problems on site, existing use of \{BBS\} for behavior improvement, difficulties in achieving widespread adoption and potential technologies for location tracking and in-time feedback. Then, a conceptual framework of positioning technology-enhanced \{BBS\} is developed, followed by details of the corresponding on-line supporting system, Real Time Location System (RTLS) and Virtual Construction System (VCS). The application of the system is then demonstrated and tested in a construction site in Hong Kong. Final comments are made concerning further research direction and prospects for wider adoption. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In an experimental study, participants (n = 79) assumed the role of control room operator of a simulated plant. For a total of 36 times, they had to decide whether to violate a safety-related rule to maximise their own salary, or to comply with it at the cost of a lower income. The experimental variation was the timing of audits in the simulated production year (“early” = audits accomplished within weeks 13–30 versus “late” = audits accomplished within weeks 31–48) and framing of production outcomes and salary (gain versus loss). Results show that early-audited participants committed significantly fewer rule violations in the early period than those who had not yet been audited. Later on, the early-audited participants began to violate the rule, whereas the late-audited participants continued violating even though they had now been audited. Participants who experienced a loss-framed production outcome committed significantly more violations than participants in the gain-framed condition. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Following the Gulf of Mexico blowout of 2010, various parties called for the introduction of safety case regulation in the US. Such regulation is well known in various other jurisdictions around the world and is regarded as best practice for the regulation of rare but catastrophic events. New regulation in the \{US\} must pass the cost/benefit test or alternatively show why strict cost/benefit analysis is inapplicable. This paper argues that safety case regulation can surmount this hurdle. It argues that strict cost/benefit analysis is impossible for safety case regulation and it demonstrates this by providing a detailed critique of the attempts by the European Commission to provide a cost/benefit justification for the introduction of safety case regulation for offshore oil and gas production in its jurisdiction. The paper argues that such regulation can be justified in the \{US\} on other grounds; first, the polluter pays principle, second, the fact that society regards multiple fatalities occurring together far more seriously than the same number of fatalities occurring separately; and third, that the incidents to be prevented are viewed by the courts as criminal and therefore to be prevented as a matter of principle. },

Based on the operational features and relevant literature, the safety factors of product tankers in coastal shipping were examined. A Safety Management Index (SMI) based on fuzzy \{AHP\} model was then proposed to assess those SFs, by which tanker carriers may make policies to improve the safety performance of product tankers. Finally, to validate the proposed model, the fleet of product tankers of Chinese Petroleum Corporation (CPC) in Taiwan was empirically investigated. The results proposed 16 \{SFs\} for product tankers in coastal shipping, in which, the \{SFs\} in need of improvement for CPC’s fleet are: safety climate onboard the ship, crew self-regulation, crew safety knowledge, safety drill onboard the ship and the condition of ship’s machinery. Based on the results, the theoretical and managerial implications for tanker carriers in improving ship safety are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Alarm management, which alerts process operators to deviations of variables from designed limits, has been a key safety issue in a petrochemical plant. Petrochemical processes frequently operate upon a multitude of steady states, transitions and states in abnormal events. Some single-fault scenarios producing similar symptoms usually cause false alarms, while fault propagation scenarios produce alarm floods which will overwhelm critical alarms. A two-level intelligent alarm management framework (IAMF) is proposed considering fault interdependence in plant operation, including alarm filtering first and root-cause diagnosis second. The two-level \{IAMF\} with different strategies are applicable to various hazard scenarios involving multi-fault with similar symptoms and propagation scenarios. Two cases are studied applying the \{IAMF\} to FCCU, in which the root causes of alarm floods can be identified. Redundant alarms, false alarms and alarm failures cut down effectively, thus ensuring the safety of the petrochemical process and reducing economic losses caused by improper alarms. },

Results of path analysis show that both perceived organizational safety support and perceived supervisor safety support influenced compliance with the risk-awareness procedure, although through different cognitive–motivational processes. Perceived organizational safety support was significantly associated with compliance via perceived usefulness of the risk-awareness procedure. On the other hand, perceived supervisor safety support was significantly related to compliance via safety motivation. The implications for theory and practice are discussed. },

In this paper two different experimental scenarios, which could be regarded as the phased evacuation and total evacuation respectively, were conducted on stairs in a high-rise building to investigate the evacuation process and pedestrian movement characteristics down stairs. The evacuation processes were recorded by video cameras, and the movement parameters were extracted from the video data. In experimental scenario one and two, the space–time distribution, the speed of participants walking through two adjacent floors and specific flow for participants through different stair landings were analyzed and discussed. Then, the fundamental diagrams for pedestrians in the two different evacuation scenarios were presented followed by the analysis of the influences of merging flow on pedestrian movement. It is found that the longer time intervals between participants occur because of the bottlenecks caused by slow movement individuals in experimental scenario one. In experimental scenario two, it is found that participants who stand in front of the queue accelerate just before the merging with participants coming from upstairs. Moreover, from the analysis of the fundamental diagram, we find that the merging flow influences pedestrians’ movement down stairs, and the detailed egress facilities and evacuation processes should be taken into account when the functions of \{SFPE\} Handbook are used to predict the evacuation variables. It is also found that the speeds of participants from upstairs are reduced by the entry of participants from the corresponding floors during the merging time period. },

In this paper, we first examine the weaknesses of current managerial accounting systems as regards the provision of systematic information on the cost of measures to ensure health and safety in the workplace. We then propose a model of management accounting to calculate, analyse and control these costs, with particular reference to construction companies. Finally, we implement a case study in a Spanish construction company, focusing on two construction projects carried out in 2008 in Andalusia (Spain). This study reveals that health and safety costs are substantial and remain invisible to the company to a very large degree (more than 90%), because the items that make up this cost are dispersed within other accounting entries, thus remaining unidentified on the income statement. Accordingly, construction companies need to implement a management accounting system to get appropriate information about safety costs, to guide their decisions in safety management. },

A comprehensive integrated network methodology was developed to evaluate and quantify the interactions between different infrastructure networks which included transportation and pipeline systems for water and sewer services. The quantitative risks were performed in terms of the individual network vulnerabilities, interactions of different networks (traffic, water, sewer), affected service areas, number of vehicles, and delays in transportation (vehicle hours) using ArcGIS. The interactive vulnerability and quantitative risk assessment methodology was demonstrated by applying for the transportation and pipeline systems infrastructure for the service area in downtown Miami, Florida. The impacts on traffic flow were evaluated by segmentation based on the node-based connections and visualized using ArcGIS. Based on the analyses, about 3.15 square miles in the case study area (17.76 square miles) is vulnerable for service interruptions which will affect traffic flow significantly. This corresponds to about 58,805 people in the service area. The integrated methodology developed can be used for asset management for developing effective maintenance programs to improve service quality in areas served by multiple infrastructure networks. },

Statistical analysis was performed to highlight the association between risk levels and drivers’ demographics and exposure characteristics. An alarming rate of 93.1% of drivers, mostly young male college students, engaged in this unsafe behavior despite being aware of the associated risk and legislative laws. Findings suggested gender, employment status, age, education level, driving experience, and daily traveled distance were associated with mobile phone use while driving. Recommendations to enhance traffic safety were proposed and further research directions were highlighted. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The concept “simple accidents” is understood as traumatic events with one victim. In the last 10 years many European countries have seen a decline in the number of fatalities, but there still remain many severe accidents at work. In the years 2009–2010 in European countries 2.0–2.4 million occupational accidents a year were notified leading to 4500 fatalities and 90,000 permanent disabilities each year. The article looks at the concept “accident” to find similarities and distinctions between major and simple accident characteristics. The purpose is to find to what extent the same kinds of prevention or safety methodologies and procedures established for major accidents are applicable to simple accidents. The article goes back to basics about accidents causes, to review the nature of successful prevention techniques and to analyze what have been constraints to getting this knowledge used more broadly. This review identifies gaps in the prevention of simple accidents, relating to safety barriers for risk control and the management processes that need to be in place to deliver those risk controls in a continuingly effective state. The article introduces the “INFO cards” as a tool for the systematic observation of hazard sources in order to ascertain whether safety barriers and management deliveries are present. Safety management and safety culture, together with the \{INFO\} cards are important factors in the prevention process. The conclusion is that we must look at safety as a part of being a professional in all kinds of jobs and occupations as well as at management level. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Fall accidents are a leading cause of fatalities and injuries in the construction industry, and the loss of bodily stability is one of the primary factors contributing to such falls. Body stability can be analyzed by studying dynamic and postural stability, the assessment of which can ultimately improve worker safety on the job sites. Previous studies have introduced a method for assessing construction workers’ gait stability, but there remains a need for a comprehensive method that can analyze the fall-risk of construction workers’ in stationary postures. This study aims to test the usefulness of two metrics—velocity of the bodily center of pressure (COPv) and the resultant accelerometer (rAcc)—as predictors with which to measure workers’ fall risk in stationary postures. A laboratory experiment was designed and conducted to gather \{IMU\} data and compare the resulting stability metrics (I-COPv and rAcc) with the postural stability observed while conducting the same activities on a forceplate (F-COPv). The experiment evaluated stationary-posture tasks with various fall-risk profiles: standing and squatting in different situations (e.g. wearing a loaded harness with a symmetric and an asymmetric load, and holding a toolbox). The analysis’s results demonstrated a significant difference in I-COPv and rAcc values across different postures and tasks and also showed considerable correlations between the metrics from both the force plate and the \{IMU\} sensors. The results showed the distinguishing power of I-COPv and rAcc in measuring the fall risk of different construction workers’ tasks in the stationary posture. },

In order to obtain an overall picture of cooking, questionnaire survey was carried out. Furthermore accident data for injured persons were categorized by the cooking processes in progress during the accident, and were analyzed in terms of age of injured person, work experience, accident type, and agency of accident. Survey results of questionnaire show that heated cooking constitutes the largest part, followed by non-heated cooking, and preparation. Also results show that the cooking process in time of the accidents resulted in differences of, such as, type of accident, period of work experience, and agency of accident; (1) Accidents during preparation were caused mainly by machine and tools (86.7%), and most victims were injured in the forms of getting caught in and between objects (45.7%) or with cuts, amputations and punctures (43.9%); (2) Cooking utensils and caldron were behind 55.4% of the accidents, and 73.3% of the accidents during heated cooking processes revealed problems with abnormal temperature; (3) Accident during handling/storing ingredients and serving were most commonly in the forms of slips and falls. Finally, a hazard identification and risk assessment table of kitchen works was derived to classify the possible incidents according to the levels of risk. These findings of accident properties according to cooking process can be used as baseline data for the establishment of systematical preventative policies. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Psychosocial risks are widely recognized as a major challenge at work, a challenge that most organizations find difficult to manage in practice. The \{OHSAS\} 18001 standard provides a framework for the management of occupational health and safety risks, including psychosocial risks. However, such occupational health and safety management (OHSM) systems tend to have difficulties in adequately addressing psychosocial risks at work. A crucial element in the \{OHSM\} system is internal audits. We have investigated how two Danish municipalities have transformed the general audit guidelines into internal audit practices capable of targeting the psychosocial risks. The results show that the municipalities experienced difficulties in transforming the general audit guidelines into practical models, and we found that this led to significant variations in audit practices. The explanation for these difficulties can be found both in the nature of the psychosocial risks and in implementation constraints. Compared to traditional safety audits, auditing psychosocial risks appears to require different methods and auditor competencies, a factor that the \{OHSAS\} 18001 standard does not explicitly take into account. On the basis of our study, we reach two major conclusions: first, that the standard provides little help in auditing the management of psychosocial risks in relation to \{OHSM\} systems; and second, that the full potential for management of psychosocial risks cannot be achieved without developing additional methods and auditor competencies for audits of psychosocial risks. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this paper, the cellular automaton model is put forward to evaluate the effect of the different drivers’ psychology in the two-lane highway. Each value of safety parameter β j i , used to reflect the jth vehicle driver’s psychology in the ith lane, represents his or her cautious or risky preference. Assuming that β j i follows normal distribution, whose mathematical expectation is β , we generate a stochastic safety coefficient for each driver in the simulation area. Based on different values of β , the vehicle flow and density are contrasted under some different traffic rules such as driving on the right, free overtaking and non-overtaking with low speed limitation. Through the cellular automaton simulation, the results demonstrate that safety parameter has less influence on the traffic flow under the lightest and heaviest traffic. Meanwhile, non-overtaking with the lowest speed limitation can increase the traffic flow in the light traffic. Free overtaking can improve the usage of the highway. With the increase of vehicle, non-overtaking with the lowest speed limitation will be of benefit to improving the traffic flow. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this study of 638 Australian nurses, compliance to hand hygiene (HH), as defined by the “five moments” recommended by the World Health Organisation (2009), was examined. Hypotheses focused on the extent to which time pressure reduces compliance and safety climate (operationalised in relation to \{HH\} using colleagues, manager, and hospital as referents) increases compliance. It also was proposed that \{HH\} climate would interact with time pressure, such that the negative effects of time pressure would be less marked when \{HH\} climate is high. The extent to which the three \{HH\} climate variables would interact among each other, either in the form of boosting or compensatory effects, was tested in an exploratory manner. A prospective research design was used in which time pressure and the \{HH\} climate variables were assessed at Time 1 and compliance was assessed by self-report two weeks later. Compliance was high but varied significantly across the 5 \{HH\} Moments, suggesting that nurses make distinctions between inherent and elective \{HH\} and also seemed to engage in some implicit rationing of HH. Time pressure dominated the utility of \{HH\} climate to have its positive impact on compliance. The most conducive workplace for compliance was one low in time pressure and high in \{HH\} climate. Colleagues were very influential in determining compliance, more so than the manager and hospital. Manager and hospital support for \{HH\} enhanced the positive effects of colleagues on compliance. Providing training and enhancing knowledge was important, not just for compliance, but for safety climate. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Organizational factors and human factors are intimately related and intermingled with each other. Therefore, development of the implications for improving work safety behaviors is difficult due to the complexities of multiple causal relations of those factors within construction safety scenarios. With an aim towards identifying the particular implications for enhancing the desired behaviors or mitigating unfavorable behaviors, Bayesian network was therefore selected as an analytical technique for providing insight into the influence of the relevant contributories by investigating variations in the output of networks. Bayesian Belief Networks have been extensively applied in research because of their capability to capture sophisticated inferences. In addition, researchers are enabled to deliberately investigate the expected consequences of uncertainty prior to establishing an effective intervention. As a result, the present alternatives highlight the useful implications that might lead to the highest probability of safe work behavior. Based on this Bayesian network, an improvement in safe work behavior can be obtained by controlling leadership, management commitment, participation, and the perceived behavioral control node. Accordingly, it is increasingly being acknowledged that management must demonstrate substantive and visible commitment to occupational safety. In addition, managers at all levels must play an important role in establishing a supportive and participative atmosphere to encourage subordinates to work in a safer way. This application and the findings from the empirical evidence of the Bayesian Belief Network can explore the influence of organizational factors and their impact on safe work behavior through manipulating a combination of organizational factors. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The “Civil Protection Act Against Accidents” entered into force in 2004 in Sweden, and stipulates management by objectives, risk analysis work, political prioritizations, and cross-sectoral work on the municipal level, entailing a new challenge for the municipalities and the rescue service. The studies presented in this article focuses on studying the discussions of politicians and staff groups in order to understand how a new law is perceived and acquires significance over time. The first study was carried out during 2003, and the second between 2009 and 2010. The result shows that attitudes regarding the ambitions of the upcoming law could be formulated in discourses about the municipality’s safety and protection work. Two main discourses emerged with certain common standpoints, Discourse I and Discourse II. Discourse I was mainly rooted in current reality and critical as regards the coming Act, while Discourse \{II\} was more rooted in the ambitions of the upcoming Act. The development from 2003 to 2010 shows a gradual shift towards a complex and conflict-laden Discourse \{II\} and a strengthening of Discourse I. Discourse II, which emanated from the intermediate level, has spread all the way up to the very highest political level, but only partly down to the lowest hierarchical level consisting of foremen and firemen.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The performance evaluation of health, safety and environment management system (HSE-MS) is considered to be an effective way to eliminate out dated measures and help managers adopt proper rectification measures. The objective of this paper is to design a weight distribution model for HSE-MS performance evaluation, the importance of which stems from the current lack of integrated approaches for interpreting and ranking HSE-MS performance evaluation elements. Initially, Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) is adopted to illustrate the direct and indirect effects of HSE-MS elements on system performance indicators, and the results of \{FCM\} are used to develop leading factors helpful for decision making in an intensive management system. Then, the weight distribution from \{FCM\} is amended by Relative Degree Analysis (RDA), the aim of which is to combine the advantages of quantitative and qualitative knowledge-driven methods. Finally, the level of HSE-MS performance is obtained and analyzed. The whole performance evaluation framework highlights the potential correlations of evaluation elements as well as expert opinions, which will improve the reasonability of the HSE-MS performance evaluation. },

The National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) developed a pilot study testing the feasibility of fire departments disseminating \{OSH\} information to small businesses during fire inspections. Methods Two sets of postcards were developed with unique, trackable \{URLs\} for the \{NIOSH\} Small Business Resource Guide. One set was distributed by firefighters, the other was mailed to small businesses. Participating inspectors were met with to discuss their experience. Results Neither distribution method resulted in a substantial number of site visits. Inspectors believed distributing postcards was an easy addition to their duties, and saw value in safety information. Conclusions There are barriers beyond awareness of availability that prevent small business owners from seeking \{OSH\} information. Research should focus on identifying barriers and developing better \{OSH\} information diffusion mechanisms. },

A dedicated STAMP-based analysis is conducted in this paper by taking the recent Sewol ferry tragedy as an example, to illustrate the utility of applying the STAMP-Model to the maritime transportation domain and to stimulate a broader view of accident mechanisms that expands casual analysis beyond immediate physical failures to a systemic view. Some recommendations are developed for continuous improvements and corrective actions to prevent such catastrophic accident from future occurrences. },

It uses as a case study the novel \{RISKGATE\} interactive database that has been created as part of collaborative efforts between multiple coal mining industry stakeholders over the last five years. The \{RISKGATE\} database operates within both the information systems and organisational learning models of knowledge management, capturing inter-organisational expert knowledge and facilitating dissemination to field practitioners through the medium of a digital web-based tool. This discussion will utilise variations of the Data–Information–Knowledge–Wisdom (DIKW) hierarchy as a means of interrogating, firstly, the process of how the various industry stakeholders codify their tacit knowledge on safety issues in the coal mining industry; and secondly, how that data is then made available through the \{RISKGATE\} database to practitioners (and others) working in the field. While Frické (2009, 131) thinks the \{DIKW\} hierarchy out-dated by reason of its ‘philosophical backdrops of operationalism and inductivism’ amongst other problems, we believe it still has relevance if considered a dynamic entity and not a fixed hierarchy. },

Although regulators in different industries have increasingly included safety culture in their regulatory repertory, it is still rare that regulators explicitly require sound cultures. In this paper we study how the requirement is ‘translated’ in two different petroleum companies, discuss why the translations differ and the extent to which they represent good organizational learning about HSE. Translation is seen as a form of organizational learning. The analysis is based on institutional theory, and a virus metaphor for adoption of organizational ideas. The translations of §15 in the two companies differ considerably. There are also signs of translatory ‘mutation’ or drift from the original intentions behind the requirement. The different translations are explained by differences in histories, complexity and strategy between the companies. The study illustrates the applicability of the translation concept for analyzing organizational learning for safety and the usefulness of a virus metaphor for evaluating learning processes. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This article examines the relationship between safety climate, risk perception and involvement in safety management by first-line managers (FLM). Sixty-three \{FLMs\} from two French nuclear plants answered a questionnaire measuring perceived workplace safety climate, perceived risk, and involvement in safety management. We hypothesized that a positive perception of safety climate would promote substantial involvement in safety management, and that this effect would be stronger than the perceived-risk effect. We also expected that safety climate dimensions would have a different impact on involvement in safety management. Especially, we expected climate dimensions dealing with safety-related exchanges between managers and their supervisees to be more related to FLMs’ involvement in safety management. As expected, perceived risk, as well as safety climate, was related to FLMs’ involvement in safety management: the more they perceived risks as probable and serious for their supervisees, the more involved they got in safety management. Similarly, \{FLMs\} who perceived a good safety climate in their company reported getting more involved in safety management than did \{FLMs\} who perceived a poor safety climate. Moreover, the results showed that safety climate was the key variable because it completely mediated the effect of perceived risk on involvement in safety management. Another important result showed that immediate supervisor encouragement was more influential than senior management views on safety. Furthermore, the fact of being called upon by supervisees on safety issues prompted the \{FLMs\} to be more involved in safety management. Possible avenues for improving the involvement of \{FLMs\} in safety management are suggested. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Safety performance functions are frequently used to describe the relation of various factors to the number of accidents, often focusing on exposure of vulnerable road users. Those studies require reliable data regarding exposure, but collecting such data is resource demanding, often resulting in short observational periods. This might produce measurement errors, influencing the reliability of the models. The aim of this work is twofold: to create a safety performance functions for pedestrian and bicyclist accidents at urban intersections, and to analyze the reliability of accident models based on short observational periods, i.e. how does random variation, resulting from short observational periods influence the models? This provides an aid for choosing between increasing the number of sites and the length of the observational period at each site. Accident data were compiled and traffic counting was conducted at 113 urban intersections in Sweden. Multiple samples were created from the counting sessions, facilitating tests of the models’ reliability based on lengths of observational periods between 15 and 180 min. Four safety performance functions (accident types) were created. All models showed a safety in numbers effect, including the model for single pedestrian accidents, which might suggest that maintenance and infrastructure quality constitute an important factor for the safety in numbers effect. A sensitivity analysis showed geometric factors, describing the infrastructure quality, influencing the safety in numbers effect, further supporting this hypothesis. The safety performance functions based on short observational periods showed low reliability, indicating that those models are subjected to a considerable measurement error. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Human performance is a major contributor to railway incidents and accidents. The literature shows that it is operators, i.e. train drivers, signallers and controllers, who mainly affect the railway system in terms of safety. Numerous studies have investigated the influence of such operators on the railway system, but are usually based on studies from other domains and cannot be reliably applied to railway specific operations. This paper presents a framework to identify the most significant human performance factors, known as Performance Shaping Factors (PSFs), which influence the performance of railway operators. These Railway-Performance Shaping Factors (R-PSFs) are derived from an extensive literature review, together with an analysis of 479 railway operational incidents and accidents over the past 15 years worldwide. Subject Matter Experts in the railway domain subsequently validated the identified factors. Statistical analysis of the railway operational incidents and accidents is subsequently conducted, following data quality checks. Based upon the Pareto principle, 12 R-PSFs account for more than 90% of the accidents and incidents, regardless of the severity of the event. Results from the analyses indicate the contribution of each individual R-PSF to the occurrence of a railway incident or accident, and highlight the importance of specific R-PSFs either individually or in combination for features related to specific types of accidents and incidents. The findings of the analysis can be used to direct resources more efficiently towards the development of sound solutions for improving the performance of railway operators. In addition, based upon the R-PSFs, a checklist of human performance factors is developed which can be used for investigation purposes and to collect human performance measures in a consistent and logical manner. The proposed checklist and its usage can greatly improve safety management systems of railway organisations. },

Nine apprentices (15–17 yr old) in different companies were videotaped whilst doing normal work tasks (total 79.5 h). Unforeseen events were described according to an observation grid constructed for this study; the following variables were characterized: unforeseen events, immediate contributing factors, strategies (individual vs. collective) and injury risk. All unexpected events observed by trained raters were coded (n = 554). Simple logistic regressions were made to determine the odd of being at risk of injury. The variable “activity sector” was used as control. Falling/dropping object (25.5%) is the most prevalent unexpected event (UE). The most important contributing factor is related to Material/products (44.1%), and Individual strategies were most frequently used by apprentices (81.5%). However, regressions showed that \{UE\} related to Handling and Equipment are the most associated with injury risks. Collective strategies to manage \{UE\} seem to have a protective role. This study illustrates the duality associated with unexpected event: the potential of those events to develop competencies or the risk of injury associated. Some implications for schools, decision-makers and employer are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractObjectives The aim was to analyze injury trends according to age, severity, work activity and business cycle in the construction sector. Methods From 1980 to 2010 a total of 23.464 work related injuries were treated at the emergency department at Odense University Hospital. The annual incidences were calculated. Employment levels in the construction sector were used as an indicator of fluctuations in the business cycle since 1980. Results Through the last three decades the overall trend of work-related injuries was unchanged. For some subgroups of injuries, such as major injuries and injuries due to young workers use of small powered tools significant downward trends were seen, but trends within different age groups of workers were unchanged and young workers have at least twice the risk compared to older workers. The fluctuations in work injury trends among workers under 30 years of age were significantly related to the business cycle, where the risk of injuries was higher during economic booms than during recessions. Further, periods with economic booms are positively related to the rate of minor injuries and injuries due to all other work activities than the use of power tools. Conclusion Overall the number of injuries in the construction sector have not changed significantly during the recent three decades, except for minor subgroups related to ‘major injuries’ and ‘injuries due to use of small power tools’. Re-evaluation of safety prevention programs is needed in order to break the high injury level among young workers compared to older workers, especially during economic booms. },

Although heat safety guidelines exist in many industries, the extent to which heat exposure is perceived to impact on workers is yet to be fully explored. In this case study, a qualitative approach was used to investigate outdoor council workers’ experiences and perceptions of heat impacts in the workplace. Thirty-two male workers participated in 5 focus groups. Proceedings were audio-recorded, transcribed and data coded using thematic analysis. Findings indicated that although existing heat policies are in place, hot weather continues to impact workers’ health and well-being, work practices and productivity. The results showed the importance of workplace management and training, and an understanding of the need for workers to be able to self-pace during hot weather. The impacts of these factors on the behavioral adaptation of workers are discussed along with implications of the research for the management of heat-related risks in workplaces. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Although Workplace Risk Assessments (WRA) are legally required in all \{EU\} member states and widely considered to be a core element of occupational safety and health (OSH) management, the state of their implementation at company level is still viewed rather critically, both in quantitative and qualitative terms. In this study, data from a representative company survey (N = 6500) were used to estimate the frequency of different patterns (and corresponding quality levels) of \{WRA\} practice in Germany and to determine organisational factors influencing the chance of occurence of these \{WRA\} patterns. Results show that only one out of four companies carry out \{WRAs\} which not only meet the essential procedural requirements but also take account of potential risk areas in a fairly comprehensive manner. Multinomial logistic regression analysis further revealed that company size is by far the strongest predictor of \{WRA\} activity, especially of its more developed forms. Availability of safety specialist assistance, availability of occupational health specialist assistance, affiliation to the production sector, presence of an employee representative body and a good economic situation of the company were each associated with \{WRA\} activity as well. The still considerable deficiencies in \{WRA\} coverage and quality indicated by this study clearly call for an intensification of WRA-related control and advisory efforts by the \{OSH\} authorities, primarily in small companies and in the private services sector. Findings also suggest that reinforcement of worker representation structures at company level and strengthening professional \{OSH\} expert utilisation would be beneficial for \{WRA\} implementation. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A pedestrian evacuation simulation model based on the extended cellular automata is proposed with the consideration of heterogeneous behavioral tendencies in humans. We investigated two behavioral tendencies, namely, familiarity and aggressiveness. Our simulation experiments tested the values of the behavioral parameters and the pedestrian flow composition. The model is calibrated and validated by using hand calculation, fundamental diagrams of traffic flow and evacuation experiments. The results show that the evacuation time decreases exponentially with an increase in the evacuees’ site familiarity and increases when pedestrians are either too conservative or too aggressive. The optimum evacuation was associated with higher familiarity and no aggressive preference. Altering the conservative compositions of pedestrian groups showed that there is a turning point for each density, depending on the proportions of conservative pedestrians. Prior to this point, the evacuation time is a relatively constant value. After this point, the evacuation time increases and fluctuates. This finding demonstrates that at high densities, a few leaders in pedestrians can significantly reduce the evacuation time. The model is able to simulate evacuation effectively given the diverse behavior strategies of evacuees, such as herding and communication between evacuees. In addition, the model can explain some basic principles of fundamental diagrams of traffic flow. Furthermore, the model is applied to optimize buildings to reduce evacuation times. Case studies show that the evacuation time can be dramatically decreased if a building is optimized to reduce interactions between different groups of pedestrians by separating flows or expanding the exit width. However, such strategies are effective only under high pedestrian densities. Placing signs and guides is also helpful for improving the evacuation performance. We conclude that behavioral tendencies have a strong influence on evacuation time. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We present novel evidence that proves the significant influence of information sources on escape judgment in a crisis situation. These influences are found to differ with intuition and after deliberative thinking. The finding addresses an important gap in crisis decision literature, in which the role of information sources is largely ignored. This omission is striking because crisis situations often involve considerable uncertainty, confusion, and panic. In such situations, the information needed to form judgments is not available. The four experiments we conducted in this study show reliable evidence of the influence of information sources on escape judgment. Experts and acquaintances activated significantly more positive judgments than strangers based on the same information at both the conscious priming level in experiment 1 and at the unconscious priming level in experiment 2. Information sources showed different influences on escape judgment with intuition and after deliberative thinking at both the conscious and the unconscious priming levels. The cross-experimental analysis in experiment 3 confirmed the priming effect of information sources. The control studies in experiment 4 indicated that the results did not reflect word familiarity. Our findings contribute to the crisis literature by demonstrating that information source is more important than information content in escape judgment. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper addresses the challenge to design an effective method for managers to efficiently process hazardous states via recorded historical data by developing a stochastic state sequence model to predict discrete safety states – represent the hazardous level of a project or individual person over a period of time through a Real-Time Location System (RTLS) on construction sites. This involves a mathematical model for state prediction that is suitable for the big-data environment of modern complex construction projects. Firstly, an algorithm is constructed for extracting incidents from pre-analysis of the walk-paths of site workers based on RTLS. The algorithm builds three categories of hazardous region distribution – certain static, uncertain static and uncertain dynamic – and employs a frequency and duration filter to remove noise and misreads. Key regions are identified as either ‘hazardous’, ‘risky’, ‘admonitory’ or ‘safe’ depending on the extent of the hazard zone from the object’s boundary, and state recognition is established by measuring incidents occurring per day and classifies personal and project states into ‘normal’, ‘incident’, ‘near-miss’ and ‘accident’. A Discrete-Time Markov Chain (DTMC) mathematical model, focusing on the interrelationship between states, is developed to predict states on construction sites. Finally, a case study is provided to demonstrate how the system can assist in monitoring discrete states and which indicates it is feasible for the construction industry. },

The different journals also show regional differences in the papers they attract. The field in total is highly multidisciplinary. The topics of Safety Science have been focused on major hazard, transportation and work safety; Journal of Safety Research divides its attention between work and traffic safety, with a smaller cluster on statistics; Accident Analysis and Prevention is concerned almost exclusively with road safety; Injury Prevention is concerned mainly with injury mechanisms, but includes topics not treated by the other 5 journals, such as violence, suicide and other intentional injury and child safety at school and in the home. Reliability Engineering and System Safety and the Journal of Loss Prevention in the Process Industries focus mainly on major hazard, with the latter most concerned with the technology of failure mechanisms and the former on quantitative risk assessment. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Due to the fact that escape panics are unexpected and dangerous, which excludes real-life experiments because of technical difficulties and ethical reasons, the evacuation simulations in real-life disasters are still rare. In this paper, the escape panics of classroom evacuation in real-life 2013 Ya’an earthquake in China are simulated and reproduced using the social force model. Firstly, a robust differential evolution (DE) is employed to calibrate and optimize the parameters of social force model to achieve a desired nonlinear evacuation speed which is consistent with real-life video data. It is demonstrated the DE-calibrated social force model can reproduce the characteristics of pedestrian flow in the real-life earthquake evacuation including the nonlinear evacuation speed curve and the pedestrian position distributions at different time. Moreover, the trained evacuation leader has remarkable impact on the evacuation process which can be beneficial to maintain the calm and order of crowd, decrease the desired velocity of crowd, and thus avoid fatal accident to the most degree. Finally, different layouts of classroom have similar evacuation efficiency because different internal layouts can only change partial flow of pedestrians in the left and right corridors, and total flow aggregating in the exit of classroom is still unchanged. However, total evacuation time can be sharply reduced to 17 s from above 36 s, and evacuation efficiency has almost doubled when the back door is open, which means we should try to keep all the emergency exits open in order to provide the crowd with more chances to escape when disasters occur. },

In this study, a Petri net based approach is proposed to model and analyze the time and resource issues of subway fire emergency response processes.

Next, resource conflict detection methods along with corresponding algorithms are proposed to detect potential resource conflicts. In addition, a priority criterion which constitutes of key-task priority strategy and waiting-short priority strategy is proposed to resolve the detected resource conflicts and optimize the whole process execution time. By experiment comparison, it is proved that our resolution strategies could effectively resolve resource conflicts as well as achieving high time performance. The proposed approach can be effectively used to simulate and train an emergency response plan to detect potential conflicts in time, sequence, and resources, before its real application. In this way, the reliability and validity of emergency response plan can be improved greatly. },

James Reason and Alan Hobbs’ Safety Culture model of a Just Culture, a Reporting Culture, and a Learning Culture was applied to the vertical aspect to measure Safety Culture in a multi-dimensional mode; a comparison of Chinese culture and Western culture on aviation safety was applied to the horizontal aspect to investigate the two different cultures. Qualitative and quantitative methods were used for this research. The interviews yielded five topics: trust, guanxi (relationship) vs. equity and equality, power distances, harmony among people, and sharing information and knowledge. For each of the five topics, questionnaires were developed to investigate the effects of cultural differences on international commercial airline pilots. A major finding was that the cultural differences strongly influence the pilots’ trust and satisfaction with the implementation of a Just Culture, a Reporting Culture, and a Learning Culture in their company. The Western pilots were more satisfied with those aspects of the Safety Culture model than were the Chinese pilots. Leadership that builds trust, includes a high power distance, and allows them to maintain harmony with their colleagues in a Reporting Culture is desired by Chinese pilots. Because it might have generated negative responses from their colleagues, Chinese pilots were more hesitant than were Western pilots to share information and knowledge. Finally, managers’ work histories, communication skills, good examples, team reporting, and incentive programs were suggested as vital for assuring the success of the Safety Culture. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper describes the operational procedures and the conditions that exist and prevail in the Search and Rescue (SAR) at sea for endangered offshore platforms (oil rigs) in Greece. More specifically, the authors collected and elaborated all the necessary information of a thorough risk governance gap analysis by means of selective scenarios all along the \{SAR\} process, while paying special attention to the respective risk governance issues. Particular information is provided for the \{SAR\} in the Greek Search and Rescue Region (SRR), for the purpose of identifying vulnerable conditions such as responsibility gaps and duplication or overlapping of duties among the different partners and stakeholders that may result in confusion and lead to operational failures. The authors approach the international and national legal framework concerning the \{SAR\} issue, the identification of the potential for \{SAR\} operations in the Greek region, namely, the Search and Rescue Units (SRUs) in Athens \{FIR\} and the public services and governmental organizations, which are likely to be involved. An analysis of the coordination process among the above mentioned stakeholders is done along with the determination of various peculiarities/uncertainties that may arise during the management of communication. The paper concludes with a proposal for action plans in various \{SAR\} scenarios and suggestions on possible locations for the On Scene Coordinator (OSC) basis. A list of possible problems and shortcomings is presented and associated with a corresponding list of solutions. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The proper identification of dangerous locations is one of the most significant phases of the Black Spot Management process. Identifying dangerous locations is a complex procedure, as they are not always located only in hazardous road sections. In fact, dangerous locations can be identified in safe sections (those having a low level of objective risk). This comparative analysis includes the results of two studies focusing on identifying hazardous road sections on the state roads in Serbia. The first study is based on field research and interviews of experts according to territorial principles (subjective method). The second study relies on analysis of data related to the history and spatial distribution of road accidents (objective method). The subject of this analysis is focused on results obtained in the analysis of the subjective and objective methods used for identifying dangerous locations. The objective of the comparative analysis is to identify differences between the results of the subjective and objective analyses, as well as to more precisely prioritize dangerous locations on Serbian roads. The comparative analysis has shown that sections with low risk according to the subjective method may include 1 km sections with very high risks, which as a consequence, may lead to incorrect selection of dangerous locations. Additionally, there are sections with a small number of recorded road accidents and a very high subjective risk. Therefore, a reliable list of prioritized dangerous locations is obtained using both methods for identification of dangerous locations and the comparative analysis of their results. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper focuses on employing the fault tree analysis method combined with quantitative analysis to investigate high-speed railway accidents. Specifically, by establishing a fault tree logic diagram based on a high-speed railway accident, an in-depth fault tree analysis combined with quantitative analysis is given to present a more comprehensive view of the accident. In quantitative analysis process, each basic event in the fault tree is endowed with uncertain characteristic due to the incompleteness of the prior information and the complexity of decision environments. With this concern, a novel method within the framework of intuitionistic fuzzy set theory is proposed to handle this problem, in which the failure possibilities of basic events are particularly treated as intuitionistic trapezoidal fuzzy numbers (ITFNs). In addition, a new ranking method for \{ITFNs\} is proposed by defining the expected values and compromise possibilities, and is efficiently employed to determine the importance degrees of all basic events. As an application, two numerical experiments are implemented to illustrate the effectiveness of the proposed fault tree analysis method, and some conclusions and suggestions are also given to decrease the occurrence possibilities of similar accidents. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the process of coal mining safety inspection in China, the different interests and influences of stakeholders and their complicated dynamic interactions make the coal mining safety laws and regulations less effective. Moreover, the existing literature on China’s coal mining safety inspection is short of research on revealling the dynamic interactions that can occur under the bounded rationality and also on proposals for effective interactions that will lead to improved safety outcomes. Therefore, this paper explores the use of evolutionary game theory to describe the interactions between the stakeholders in China’s coal mining safety inspection system, which includes the State Administration of Coal Mine Safety (SACMS), the Local Regulation Departments of Coal Mine Safety (LRDCMS), and coal enterprises. Moreover, the paper also explores dynamic simulations of the evolutionary game model to analyze the stability of stakeholder interactions and to identify equilibrium solutions. The simulation results show that the strategy selections of the three stakeholders fluctuate repeatedly, which indicates that the evolutionary stable strategy does not exist in the current interactions between the stakeholders. Therefore, the dynamic penalty control scenario and an optimized dynamic penalty-incentive control scenario were proposed to control the fluctuations and then simulated again. And the simulation results indicated that the dynamic penalty control scenario can effectively restrain the fluctuations and make stakeholder interactions more stable. Furthermore, the optimized dynamic penalty-incentive control scenario can not only restrain the fluctuations effectively but also present an ideal evolutionary stable strategy in which coal enterprises could nearly choose safety production as their optimal strategy. },

It also explores in some detail the relationship between hazards, accidents and accident-causing mechanisms. The accident-causing mechanism of “three layer of defense” is proposed based on root hazards and status hazards definition and classification, including control criteria, control measures, and rectification measures, which demonstrates that the uncontrolled status hazards and unidentified status hazards are the two main accident-causing sources. The paper then ideas of polarized management of hazards as a means of maximizing the identification of the root hazards and their corresponding status hazards, minimizing out of control probability of the identified status hazards, and minimizing accidents probability caused by the uncontrolled status hazards. Finally, the polarized management methods of hazards are put forward respectively, which include root-status hazards identification, formulation of control criteria and control measures, and rectification measures. },

This study explored the relationships between four dimensions of safety climate (management commitment, safety supervision, coworker support, and safety training), three dimensions of safety behavior (safety compliance, personal protective equipment, and safety initiatives), and occupational injuries among Chinese manufacturing workers. A cross-sectional survey was conducted using a sample of 3970 manufacturing workers from 42 companies in Zhongshan City, China. A structured questionnaire was used to capture participants’ socio-demographic characteristics, occupational safety climate, occupational safety behavior, and occupational injuries in the previous year. Path analysis was used to test the relationships between safety climate, safety behavior and injuries at each workplace. The results revealed significant associations between different safety climates, safety behavior, and unintentional injuries, and provided evidence that safety behavior strongly mediates the relationship between safety climate and unintentional injuries. Our study reinforces the empirical association of occupational safety climate and safety behavior with occupational injuries and identifies some effective measures to prevent and control injuries in Chinese workplaces. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Safety and quality performance share a symbiotic relationship. Despite the extensive amount of research that has provided quantitative assessments of the financial impact of rework, there have been limited studies that have examined the relationship between safety performance (i.e. in terms of the number of incidents arising) and rework that occurs from the issue of non-conformances (NCRs). Using an exploratory case study approach, the statistical characteristics of incidents (n = 16,885) and \{NCRs\} (n = 2885) requiring rework experienced by a tier one Australian contractor over a 31 month period are analyzed and their relationship determined. A significant association between incidents and rework \{NCRs\} was revealed (p &lt; 0.05). The skewness and kurtosis values of monthly incidents and \{NCRs\} are computed to determine if the empirical distribution of the data follows a Normal distribution. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov, Anderson–Darling and Chi-Squared non-parametric tests are used to determine the ‘Goodness of Fit’ of the selected probability distributions. An Inverse Gaussian probability function is found to be the best overall distribution fit for the monthly incidents and used to calculate the probability of their occurrence. A Lognormal probability function was found to be the best overall distribution fit for the \{NCRs\} and also used to calculate their likelihood of occurring. Ascertaining the best fit probability distribution from an empirical distribution can produce realistic probabilities of incidents and NCRs, which should then be incorporated into a contractor’s risk management and continuous improvement strategy. },

Good behavioural models can help increase the safety of transportation systems and buildings in extreme situations like fires or terrorist attacks. Although it is well known that the interaction with other decision makers affects human behaviour, the role of social influences during evacuations still needs to be investigated. This paper contributes to fill this gap by analysing the occurrence of Herding Behaviour (HB) in exit choice. Theoretical explanations of \{HB\} are presented together with some modelling approaches used in different fields where \{HB\} is relevant. A discrete choice stated preference experiment is then carried out to study the role of \{HB\} in the decision-making process concerning exit choice during evacuation. A binary logit model is proposed showing that the occurrences of \{HB\} are affected by both environmental and personal factors. In particular, the model shows that the personal aptitude to \{HB\} can have a key role in selecting an exit. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The construction of a people-oriented safety culture is the key method to strengthen miners’ rule-following behavior (RFB) and decrease the probability of accidents in mines. Beginning with two forms of the inner composition of safety culture, this study dissects the theoretical connotations of espoused and lived safety cultures. Based on the distinction between the types of safety regulatory frameworks, such as intrinsic and extrinsic RFB, we studied previous theories (social exchange theory and person-organization fit theory) and analyzed the role of two forms of safety culture and supplies-needs congruence on miners’ RFB. Using quadratic polynomial regression with response surface analysis, we drew upon a survey of 276 miners in large state-owned coal mines in China to analyze the influence of coal mine espoused safety culture–miners’ needs (ESC–MN) congruence on miners’ \{RFB\} and discussed the mediating role of lived safety culture–miners’ needs (LSC–MN) congruence. Our findings demonstrate that coal mine ESC–MN congruence has strong non-linear effects on both intrinsic and extrinsic RFB, and that the mediating role of LSC–MN congruence is strong toward intrinsic, but not toward extrinsic, RFB. Additionally, our study brings up the definition of fit congruence in coal mine ESC–MN and calculates its range of applicability to the actual needs of miners. Based on our research results, we present suggestions for further research on coal mine safety management. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Wearing personal protective equipment (PPE) such as face masks and gloves during work is the most direct and efficient measure of preventing and reducing occupational diseases for workers exposed to organic solvents. However, the use of \{PPE\} among migrant workers is rarely studied in China. This article examines both individual and organizational factors associated with Chinese migrant workers’ compliance with the use of PPE, and also determines the relative importance of these factors. Data were collected in 2012 through a cross-sectional survey including 907 rural-to-urban migrants exposed to organic solvents working at small- and medium-size enterprises (SMEs) in the Pearl River Delta Region (PRDR). A Health Promotion Model (HPM) was used as a theoretical framework to examine the predictors affecting \{PPE\} use. Analysis was performed using two-level logistic regression. For the use of face masks, after controlling for other variables, higher scores on social models and interpersonal support were significant predictors for greater \{PPE\} use, with \{OR\} 1.24 (95% CI: 1.13–1.35) and \{OR\} 1.14 (95% CI: 1.03–1.27). In addition, after controlling for other variables, higher social models and social norms were significant predictors of glove use, with \{OR\} 1.36 (95% CI: 1.23–1.50) and \{OR\} 1.19 (95% CI: 1.09–1.32). Our results suggest that priority should be given to enhancing social modeling, social norms and interpersonal support as a strategy to improve migrant workers’ compliance with \{PPE\} use. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In China, post-accident fire prevention campaigns are highly popular; many extensive safety campaigns have been carried out after the deadliest fire accidents. The aim of this work is to explore the suppressive effect of six fire prevention campaigns initiated after disastrous fires that resulted in very high numbers of casualties and significant losses. Time series intervention models are employed to investigate the effects of fire prevention campaigns on a monthly time series of fires (1997–2010), fire deaths (1997–2010) and high-casualty fires (2000–2010). The suppressive effects produced by the campaigns that followed the Luoyang Dongdu mall fire and the \{CCTV\} new building fire are also determined. The effects of the campaigns on the fire series following both fires exhibit an exponential decay pattern with a sudden “pulse” decrement after the start of the intervention followed by a gradual deceleration back to the original pre-intervention level; the most significant finding is that there is no permanent effect from these interventions. The effect of the campaign precipitated by the Luoyang Dongdu mall fire on the fire series is greater than that from the campaign initiated after the \{CCTV\} new building fire. The campaign precipitated by the Luoyang Dongdu mall fire also produces an approximate damped sine wave suppressive effect with a permanent decrement of 43 deaths. However, the high-casualty fire series is demonstrated to not be influenced by fire prevention campaigns precipitated by disastrous fires, which is inconsistent with the campaigns’ hypotheses that high-casualty fires would decrease. },

However, apart from health issues, the effect that construction sounds have on safety issues such as workers’ safety decisions is unknown. In this study, a virtual construction simulator has been employed to investigate the effect sound has on people’s safety decisions. It is found that the addition of background sound to a high fidelity virtual reality simulator enhances people’s sense of presence by creating a high level of normality. More people make safe decisions when background sound is present in the virtual construction simulator, and salient sound is helpful in recognizing the related risks. Safe behaviors learnt in a virtual construction environment can effectively reduce unsafe behaviors in a corresponding physical environment. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Safety management is the most important part of the construction management on building engineering which has dynamic work environment and complicated construction procedure. Safety checking which identifies hazards before they occur is a core process of safety management on construction sites. However, the traditional construction safety checking which is operated by the experienced manager is manual and time-consuming. In order to integrate new technology into the construction safety checking system, a meta model for construction safety checking i.e. \{CSCOntology\} (Construction Safety Checking Ontology) has been developed in this paper. This model is formalized using an ontology language, \{OWL\} for encoding knowledge over the Web. Safety checking constraints which can extract from construction safety regulation provisions are represented with a rule language, SWRL. Then the construction safety checking processes are implemented in the JESS, a rule engine for the Java platform by transforming \{OWL\} knowledge into \{JESS\} facts, and \{SWRL\} constraints into \{JESS\} rules. A real-world example has been demonstrated in Protégé 3.4 beta to show the proposed safety checking process, according to the regulation examples taken from “29 \{CFR\} 1926 \{OSHA\} Construction Industry Regulations”. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper describes an experimental study of workers’ responses to proximity warnings of static safety hazards on construction sites using a location-based proximity warning system named the Proactive Construction Management System (PCMS). A method of evaluating workers’ responses to proximity warnings is proposed. The method consists of six variables: warning time and distance (the time and the minimum distance to a hazard when a worker receives a warning), dangerous time and distance (the time and the minimum distance to the hazard when the worker comes close to the hazard), and response time and distance (the difference between dangerous time and warning time, and the difference between dangerous distance and warning distance). Finally, whether a worker responds to a warning is evaluated against a two-second threshold and a two-meter threshold in terms of response time and distance respectively. The experiment was conducted over 17 workdays with the participation of 72 workers and resulted in 5391 warnings on a real-life construction project in Shanghai, China. The workers’ responses were analyzed with respect to two factors: building trades and a-priori risk levels. The research found that workers responded to proximity warnings actively, but slightly differently across the selected building trades; carpenters had longer response latency in hazardous areas than ironworkers did, and response percentages were high for hazardous areas with high risks. The results also show evidence that \{PCMS\} has the potential to improve workers’ safety performance. The limitations of the present study and future research directions are also addressed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper analyzes the factors influencing safety investment decisions by the government and enterprises from an opportunity cost perspective, which consists of shortage cost due to the occurrence of accidents and excess cost due to investing more than required for accident prevention. Analytical models are built by minimizing expected total opportunity costs. The result of government decision reveals that optimal government safety investments vary positively with unit shortage cost, while they vary inversely with unit excess cost. The mandatory safety investment level established by government for enterprises, which is exactly the same as the optimal government safety investment level, can compel the enterprise to invest more in safety measures when it is higher than the optimal enterprise safety investment level without the mandatory standard. Based on the analytical models, factors influencing safety investment decisions are analyzed through consideration of a case study of China. The results of the case study indicate that the ineffective administrative accountability system, performance appraisal system of local government and officials and government–enterprise relations all contribute to the high accident frequency in China by leading to a safety investment decision with a lower safety level, which also verify that the analytical models proposed in this paper are reasonable. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Automatic identification of construction safety issues using Building Information Models requires an understanding of the safety risk drivers that are detectable during the design phase. However, literature is scarce on risk identification tools and no set of drivers has been suggested to date to address construction accidents. Plenty of accidents do occur under circumstances that can be distinguished by analyzing project documents, but available BIM-based tools are currently limited to checking the clauses of safety standards. This research provides five sets of safety risk drivers that can influence either the probability or the consequences of an accident, the application of which helps identify more than 40% of potential fatalities in construction projects. The results reflect the design attributes and environmental conditions found playing a key role in the occurrence of 363 accidents reported by three different sources, and are associated with object oriented rules that are classified into four categories depending on how they are to be processed by rule checking engines. The so classified drivers can be checked to determine if safety risks are likely to arise in a project, while they maintain an acceptable level of comprehensiveness as \{BIM\} technologies progress. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract An observational study, focusing on motorcyclists, was conducted between June and August 2012 at access points on straight road sections of primary roads in Malaysia. This was done in order to gain more insight into the actual road traffic situation at these sites. The majority of the motorcyclists kept to the speed limit and lowered speed when approaching an access point, especially when road users were on it. However, when the primary road traffic volume was high, they maintained higher speeds compared to other vehicles. The behavioral observations revealed a risky right turning movement, i.e. Opposite Indirect Right Turn (OIRT), from the access point into the primary road. Motorcyclists generally had a high compliance rate of helmet (except for female motorcyclists) and headlight usage. Motorcyclists attempting to enter the primary road were poor at utilizing the turning indicator. They were observed not to turn their heads to look for vehicles when entering a road with a low volume of traffic, compared to entering a road with a high volume of traffic. Most of the motorcyclists did not comply with the stop line rule, especially those who made the OIRT. Motorcyclists entering from the access point are involved in serious traffic conflicts to about the same extent as other vehicles. Moreover, motorcyclists who stopped at the stop line and made a right turn into the primary road by accepting a short gap, resulting in a time lag of less than 4 s, were involved in the majority of the serious conflicts. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Undoubtedly, no specific method exists to measure the cost of displeasure among employees due to unpleasant or non-ergonomic work conditions. Despite the financial impact of these hidden costs on organizations’ performance, these types of expenses are usually ignored. The intangible costs are insubstantial and represent expenses that have no common quantity or labeled value attached to them. Estimating intangible costs related to work conditions based on stress level among employees is a technique that attempts to formulize a multidimensional relationship between input qualitative variables related to the state of work conditions or work injuries and the monetary value of the hidden costs encountered with them. This technique approaches the problem from a unique standpoint, revealing the concealed effect of the state of disorder of the production system and the stress level among employees that impact the overall efficiency. In addition, the influence of the stress level on the invisible costs of the optimal amount of labor and capital due to reduced ergonomic work conditions will be investigated over both the short run and the long run. Finally, the effect of work conditions on profit-cost-volume and the breakeven quantity will be formulated. },

This study investigated psychosocial precursors of action errors and violations and postulated two main hypotheses: (a) there is a positive association between emotional exhaustion and action errors/violations, and health complaints and reduced engagement mediate this relationship (the “adverse pathway”); (b) there is a negative relationship between engagement and action errors/violations, and health complaints mediate the relationship (the “beneficial pathway”). Six hundred and fifty-three oil production workers from two oil rigs responded to a survey measuring the study variables. Findings from regression analyses supported the hypotheses, except for the expected mediation of health complaints of the emotional exhaustion and action errors/violations relationship. Additional findings were that temporary contractor workers reported a lower level of action errors/violations than permanent employees did, and that reported action errors and violations increased with reported overtime hours. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Automotive engineers have to meet evolving customer expectations, particularly growing concerns for safety, by introducing new sophisticated devices like Line Keeping Assistance, Collision Mitigation Braking System or Pedestrian Detection. These devices are composed of electrical components. They are likely to be subject to failures that may impact automobile safety, which means the safety of the vehicle occupants or pedestrians. Recent standards like \{ISO\} 26262 aim at mitigating these safety problems. Automobile engineers must prove that they perform safety studies along the design process. Meanwhile, they have to cope with other changes in their engineering practices. Due to the goals of verifying the satisfaction of all requirements, the design offices have introduced new practices based on Systems Engineering (SE) which are based on models. \{SE\} tools or processes are based on a functional approach of the system in which dysfunctional aspects are missing. Thus, there is a need to integrate the safety domain into the \{SE\} framework in order to improve safety studies and the collaboration between systems engineers and safety specialists. This paper analyzes this issue by focusing on the definition of high-level (or vehicle-level) safety requirements. It proposes a Safe Systems Requirement Engineering Process and a method named Operational and System Hazard Analysis (O&amp;SHA) that helps to specify the high-level safety requirements (called safety goals in \{ISO\} 26262). It is based on a Model-Based Systems Engineering approach (MBSE) which integrates safety aspects. The added value of the proposed method is illustrated by applying it to two case studies. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Most of the risk models for ship-grounding accidents do not fully utilize available evidence, since it is based on accident statistics and expert opinions. The major issue with such kinds of models is their limitation in supporting the process of risk-management with respect to grounding accidents, since they do not reflect the reality to the extent required. This paper presents an evidence-based and expert-supported approach to structure a model assessing the probability of ship-grounding accidents, to make it more suitable for risk-management purposes. The approach focuses on using evidential data of ship-grounding accidents extracted from the actual accident and incident reports as well as the judgement elicited from the experts regarding the links and probabilities not supported by the reports. The developed probabilistic model gathers, in a causal fashion, the evidential contributing factors in ship-grounding accidents. The outcome of the model is the probability of a ship-grounding accident given the prior and posterior probabilities of the contributing factors. Moreover, the uncertainties associated with the elements of the model are clearly communicated to the end-user adopting a concept of strength-of-knowledge. The model can be used to suggest proper risk-control-measures to mitigate the risk. By running uncertainty and sensitivity analyses of the model, the areas that need more research for making educated decisions are defined. The model suggests the high-level critical parameters that need proper control measures are complexity of waterways, traffic situations encountered, and off-coursed ships. The critical area that calls for more investigation is the onboard presence of a sea-pilot. },

The objective was to find the type of knowledge that can be extracted from such sources and discuss the usability of accident and incident reports for evidence-based risk modeling. A new version of Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS) is introduced as a framework to review the accident reports. The new positive taxonomy as Safety Factors, which are based on high level positive functions that are prerequisite for safe transport operations, is used for reviewing the incident reports. Accident reports are shown as a reliable source of evidence to extract the most significant contributing factors in the events. Mandatory incident reports are considered useful for understanding the effective barriers as risk control measures. Voluntary incident reports, though, are seen as not very reliable in their current form to be used for evidence-based risk modeling. },

Data were collected from 3068 direct care workers in long-term care. The study used 2 analytical techniques: confirmatory factor analysis (CFA) and structural equation modeling (SEM). \{CFA\} tested whether the observed variables measured the latent constructs of psychological strain, workplace hazards, and supervisor support. \{SEM\} was used to test direct and indirect relationships among the variables. Perceptions of workplace hazards were significantly and positively associated with psychological strain (β = .50, p &lt; .001), which in turn was related to direct care workers’ higher turnover intentions and lower job satisfaction. Support from workplace supervisors did not moderate the workplace hazard risk perceptions–psychological strain relationship. These findings suggest that direct care workers’ perceptions of workplace hazards are related to reduced job satisfaction and higher intentions to quit. Our findings identify the need for organizations to reduce physical hazards in the workplace and acknowledge how perceptions of workplace hazards may reduce workers’ psychological health. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Commercial fishing is the most dangerous of professional callings, widely recognized as a major source of fatalities and injuries per population size within participating nations. The majority of reported fisheries injury accident data from a state is based solely on self-completed reporting formats. These formats are currently significantly limiting in their ability to tease out the incident specifics, being insufficiently detail orientated to adequately capture the range of contributing factors in the events that unfolded onboard. The content of these report forms ultimately determines the depth to which accidents may be probed in the interest of preventative learning. The problem faced by researchers is that the paucity of information on the circumstances of accident occurrences in these records, makes it a matter of gleaning every possible detail from relatively blank canvases. This article aims to focus the diffuse literary knowledge of the deficiencies pertinent to accident reporting in fisheries and subsequent knowledge extraction capabilities. Critiquing current reporting mechanisms, with a view to illustrating the extent of the problems, promoting the necessity for change and provoking discussion on how accident reporting could be improved in the future. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractIntroduction The opening of a new emergency department creates numerous unknowns that can become latent safety threats (LSTs) to patient welfare. Healthcare providers can also experience increased stress working in a novel environment, which has been shown to negatively affect decision making, teamwork, and ultimately patient safety. Methods In order to identify \{LSTs\} and orient staff, multidisciplinary teams participated in 15 in-situ simulations followed by focused debriefing sessions that stressed uncovering \{LSTs\} prior to the ED’s opening. Participants also received an electronic, de-identified survey requesting feedback and recollection of any additional \{LSTs\} not mentioned during the debriefing. Staff members were then sent the NASA-Task Load Index questionnaire during the first week of opening, which focused on the staff members stress level. Results Over 100 healthcare workers of various disciplines participated in 15 in-situ simulations over the course of one day. Thirty-five \{LSTs\} were identified and modified before the opening of the new emergency department. The majority (93%) of participants felt that simulations helped them orient to the new space. While the absolute level of stress was the same between cohorts, irritation and discouragement were 16% less in the group completing the simulation. Discussion In-situ simulations performed prior to the opening of a new emergency department identified 35 modifiable latent safety threats. Simulations were an effective way to orient staff to the new space and seemed to decrease the level of discouragement and irritation of healthcare workers during the first few weeks of the emergency department’s opening. },

Aiming to better understand the development of hazard-perception abilities in dynamic road situations we examined participants’ hazard detection abilities in a virtual environment. Method Experienced-adult participants and child-pedestrians observed typical road crossing related scenarios from a pedestrian’s point of view and engaged in a hazard detection task. Results Consistent with our hypotheses, less instances of obscured field of view by parked vehicles were reported as hazardous by 7–9-year-olds, who were also prone to linger more in identifying situations depicting field of view partially obscured by parked vehicles compared to all other age groups. Reports of obscured field of view by road curvature as hazardous increased with age. Conclusions Understanding child-pedestrians’ shortcomings in evaluating traffic situations contribute to the effort of producing intervention techniques which may increase their attentiveness toward potential hazards and lead toward reduction in their over-involvement in crashes. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The aim of this research was to identify the major factors responsible for fatal occupational accidents in forest harvesting operations in Turkey. A model was developed which determined five main factors and forty-five sub-factors leading to accidents during forestry operations, and then the Analytic Hierarchy Process (AHP) was used to determine the degree of importance of the factors and sub-factors in the model. In addition, the faulty behavioural risks of several recent fatal accidents which occurred in the Western Black Sea region of Turkey were identified using the \{AHP\} model. In conclusion, personal factors (32%) and organisational factors (22%) were ranked as the two most important causes of the incidences of fatal forest harvesting accidents. Furthermore, the major effective sub-factors causing fatal accidents were found. These included positioning in dangerous zone (5.0%), carelessness (4.9%), disorderly behaviour (4.9%), and unsuitable selection of workers (4.7%). It was observed that the risk level of these recent fatal accidents exceeded the risk limit value, which ranged from 0.578 to 0.718. The analysis revealed that forest managers should assign a more important role to training and selection of workers in order to reduce the number of fatal harvesting accidents. Although the application of the model proposed in this study is specific to fatal forestry harvesting accidents, it could be modified and applied to other types of forestry accidents. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Many current risk assessment methods are used to evaluate, eliminate or mitigate potential risks in an engineering design process. One technique that has been widely used in the design process is known as Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA). The method assumes failure modes which occur in a system and effects of failures are subsequently evaluated. A risk priority number (RPN) is employed to assess the influence of failures in FMEA. The \{RPN\} is a product of three indicators (severity, occurrence and detection) on a numerical scale from 1 to 10. However, the \{RPN\} approach has been criticized for its several shortcomings. The assumption that the \{RPN\} factors are equally weighted leads to over simplification. Furthermore, the \{RPN\} has high duplication rates and does not consider ordered weight rules. An integrated methodology based on ordered weighted geometric averaging (OWGA) and generalized mixture operators (GMOs) is proposed to overcome the inherent shortcomings of \{RPN\} and improve design safety. A case study, which assesses the critical causes of failures of a motor yacht fuel system, is presented to demonstrate the applicability of the proposed approach. Obtained results showed that the methodology overcomes duplicated \{RPN\} values, and gets a more accurate, reasonable risk assessment in engineering design phases. },

These decisions are made by individuals when maneuvering in an environment occupied by other people or obstacles. The model developed in this paper examines how human movement can be captured as a result of a decision-making process rather than modeling the behavior directly. In this paper, a novel utility function is formed from the biological-based preference of minimizing energy consumption. This energy function is partially fashioned from the energies due to moving, colliding, and waiting. Time and risk preferences are incorporated into the utility function to uniquely capture human desires. Decision and game theories are used to model the decision making process of individuals when alone and when interacting with a range of evacuee types (panicked, distracted and alert). Beliefs are formed and updated concerning both the environment and individuals in the environment, to truly capture the knowledge of individual evacuees. Assumptions that were made during the creation of this novel decision-focused movement model are discussed throughout the paper. This work expands upon previous research performed using the obstacle avoidance technique known as the velocity obstacle method. Common human traits and tendencies are proven to exist in the model through multiple examples. Future modifications of this alternative approach to traditional behavior-focused movement models are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Due to increased outsourcing in many industries, organizations are becoming larger and more interorganizationally complex and numerous operations now require cooperation among employees from different organizations. This paper presents a review of empirical literature addressing safety issues in complex interorganizational systems wherein the potential for major organizational accidents is present. Thematic analysis of the literature resulted in four main themes: economic pressures, disorganization, dilution of competence and organizational differences. The themes were viewed in light of different theoretical perspectives on organizational accident risk. The findings suggest that issues due to interorganizational complexity can hinder efficient safety management and thereby elevate the risk of organizational accidents. It is emphasized that further research is needed to better understand the implications of interorganizational complexity on safety management. },

A random sample of 200 medication- and 200 medical device-related clinical incidents in Australia were reviewed using the \{HFCF\} for patient safety. The framework identified key precursor events (PE) and contributing factors (CF) of these events. Descriptive statistics and correspondence analysis were used to examine the characteristics of the events. Medication and communication or documentation issues were the most common types of \{PE\} identified for medication incidents, while for medical devices the most common \{PEs\} were medical device breakage/failure or lack of medical equipment. Correspondence analysis for medication incidents showed that rule-based errors were strongly related to omitted dose or wrong drug. Factors relating to the organisation (86.5% and 25.0%) or the patient (7.7% and 17.9%) were the most commonly identified \{CFs\} for both medication and medical device-related incidents, respectively. The \{HFCF\} for patient safety identified the role of human factors, particularly human error, in non-fatal clinical incidents involving medication and medical devices, highlighting the need for targeted approaches to inform risk management strategies in the healthcare sector based on an understanding of how and why these incidents occur. },

Objective This study aims to analyse the coding reliability and validity of a set of variables of work accident report forms notified to the Catalan labour authority. Methods Cross sectional double-blind study. Study population: workers who had suffered a work accident with associated sick leave between October 1st and December 31st 2010 in Catalonia. Reliability of variables related to the characteristics of the worker, their workplace and the accident was analysed with the agreement reliability coefficient (Kappa index). Sensitivity, specificity, positive and negative predictive values were calculated to determine its validity. Results The variables selected in relation to the characteristics of the worker and his/her workplace had a good to excellent reliability; those variables related to the accident causes had low to moderate reliability. Conclusions There is great room for improvement in the quality of data of work accident report forms and the different governments involved should increase their efforts in this sense. These actions should be aimed to improve quality of preventive public policies and its efficiency. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Despite the massive developments in new technologies, materials and industrial systems, notably supported by advanced structural and risk control assessments, recent major accidents are challenging the practicality and effectiveness of risk control measures designed to improve reliability and reduce the likelihood of losses. Contemporary investigations of accidents occurred in high-technology systems highlighted the connection between human-related issues and major events, which led to catastrophic consequences. Consequently, the understanding of human behavioural characteristics interlaced with current technology aspects and organisational context seems to be of paramount importance for the safety &amp; reliability field. First, significant drawbacks related to the human performance data collection will be minimised by the development of a novel industrial accidents dataset, the Multi-attribute Technological Accidents Dataset (MATA-D), which groups 238 major accidents from different industrial backgrounds and classifies them under a common framework (the Contextual Control Model used as basis for the Cognitive Reliability and Error Analysis Method). The accidents collection and the detailed interpretation will provide a rich data source, enabling the usage of integrated information to generate input to design improvement schemes. Then, implications to improve robustness of system design and tackle the surrounding factors and tendencies that could lead to the manifestation of human errors will be effectively addressed. },

An electronic literature search (June 2014) was conducted to identify eligible interventions: those involving active involvement from workers/management in the construction industry; targeted one/both of the primary outcomes. All intervention designs involving construction workers aged &gt;18 years, published in English and in a peer-reviewed journal were included. Fifteen studies were included, half of which successfully improved injury rates. Longer interventions and those that included active/volitional \{BCTs\} (feedback/monitoring rather than instruction/information) were more effective. The methodological quality of the interventions was poor and use of theory was inconsistent and infrequent. Despite some positive results, very few interventions achieved all their aims. More rigorous, theory-driven research is needed to structure intervention efforts and determine the mechanism of action of effective interventions. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In many safety–critical systems, it is necessary to maintain operators’ situation awareness at a high level to ensure the safety of operations. Today, in many such systems, operators have to rely on the principles and design of human-system interfaces (HSIs) to observe and comprehend the overwhelming amount of process data. Thus, poor \{HSIs\} may cause serious consequences, such as occupational accidents and diseases including stress, and they have therefore been considered an emerging risk. Despite the importance of this, very few methods have as yet been developed to assess the risk of HSIs. This paper presents a new risk assessment method that relies upon operators’ mental models, human reliability analysis (HRA) event tree, and the situation awareness global assessment technique (SAGAT) to produce a risk profile for the intended HSI. In the proposed method, the operator’s understanding (i.e. mental models) about possible abnormal situations in the intended plant is modeled on the basis of the capabilities of Bayesian networks. The situation models are combined with the \{HRA\} event tree, which paves the way for the incorporation of operator responses in the assessment method. Probe questions in line with the \{SAGAT\} through simulated scenarios in a virtual environment are then administrated to gather operator responses. Finally, the proposed method determines a risk level for the \{HSI\} by assigning the operator responses to the developed situational networks. The performance of the proposed method is investigated through a case study at a chemical plant. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A precondition for a holistic, systemic and systematic management of offshore helicopter operations’ safety is an in-depth understanding of the corresponding system. This is essential because the components and the interactions between these components largely shape system and human performance, with the potential to create safety hazards and risks. However, current techniques of system component description in aviation are poorly specified, which contributes to a silo approach to hazard identification and risk analysis, poor safety management and missed safety targets. This paper addresses this shortcoming by developing a novel process to characterise the component-based system architecture of commercial air operations and implementing the process to create the Offshore Helicopter Transportation System Model. The paper discusses the theoretical justifications for generating such a system model and the shortcomings of the techniques currently recommended. In order to redress these, the process combines two task analysis techniques to derive an unbiased seminal system model, which is then compared to relevant models in the safety literature to ensure completeness. The process and resulting system model are validated by carefully selected subject matter experts during training sessions in high-fidelity flight simulators. The process can be applied to describe, by means of a system model, the activities of other industries in the aviation domain. Moreover, the model derived provides, for the first time, the necessary anchoring for future safety analyses in offshore helicopter operations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The incidence of driving a train through a stop signal continues to have implications for safety on railways. Industry rulebooks advise how to manage these events, but there has been very little investigation of causality from the systems-view. The increasing trend for maximising rail capacities could be exacerbating the issue and warrants investigation from this perspective to determine the factors impinging on safety decisions in train driving. A participative research approach incorporating cab rides, focus groups, and a generative scenario simulation exercise was used to investigate how train movements and safety risk was managed, and the implications of this on the rail organisation. Twenty-eight train drivers participated from eight passenger rail organisations across Australia and New Zealand. Inductive thematic analysis of the data revealed factors associated with (1) changes to signal meaning, (2) the nature of the driver-signal relationship, and (3) the confounding practice of asking a driver if they were “fit to continue” driving after going through a stop signal. The findings reflected a strong pattern of a normalisation of deviance. The results are discussed in terms of the mechanisms underlying the observed phenomenon and a model outlining prospective solutions for future research is presented to contribute to the development of novel ideas for further thinking and research. },

Many people were infected after consuming meat resulting in a number of deaths. In the present study we applied a systems approach to both the outbreak reports to analyse and compare the accidents. Using the Accimap method of systems analysis, this study investigates the human errors and organisational issues involved in the outbreaks and why accidents such as these occur in the food production domain. The systems analysis carried out in this study on the two outbreaks indicates that there are both common as well as unique factors associated with the two outbreaks. The study concludes that it is necessary to address food safety from a systemic point of view and identify and solve the various problems that could arise in the system, in the pre-incubation period before the outbreak actually occurs. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Road traffic injury is the leading cause of work-related death and serious injury in Australia. Despite this, limited attention has been given to the development and implementation of effective preventive strategies within the workplace setting. A safe driving environment at work not only depends on individual compliance with safe driving practices but on all individuals understanding risks, anticipating threats to safety, showing concern for the safety of others, and contributing to safety improvements in the organisation. In particular, workgroup supervisors play a pivotal role in creating a safe work environment. This paper describes a new and innovative conceptual framework for a program designed to improve work-related driver safety. The focus of this program is on developing the skills of supervisors in identifying situations in which their drivers may be at risk on the road (e.g., drivers are tired, stressed, under pressure to meet deadlines) and to managing these situations through effective safety leadership. This paper describes development of the Safety Management for the Occupational Driver (SMOD) program and an implementation case study. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the world especially in China, domino accidents lead to great losses of life and property. The frequency of one LOC, which is hard to estimate, is the key for the current methods. A new methodology called relative risk analysis is presented, which focuses on the discrepancy of potential losses between two domino scenarios. Moreover, the synergetic effects, which can lead to more serious losses, can be taken into account by this method. And the possibility of one specific complex propagation pattern is not necessary. The methodology is based on the damage map which can describe damage levels and impacted region caused by the domino accidents. It can be used to find a much safer layout for the process plants and better emergency plans. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractBackground Although men have a higher risk of occupational injuries than women the role of masculinity for organizational safety outcomes has only rarely been the object of research. Aim The current study investigated the association between masculinity and safety oversights, safety priority and safety violations in two male-dominated occupations using both a trait-based and a norm-based approach to masculinity. Methods Questionnaires covering trait-based (Bem Sex Role Inventory, BSRI) and norm-based (Male Role Norms Inventory – Revised, MRNI-R) measures of masculinity, three safety-related context factors (safety leadership, commitment of the safety representative, and safety involvement) and three safety-related outcome factors (safety violations, safety oversights and safety priority) were administered twice 12 months apart to Danish ambulance workers (n = 1157) and slaughterhouse workers (n = 920). Results Although the level of masculinity differed, the same general pattern of associations was identified across the two study populations. A high score on the \{MRNI\} was associated with a higher level of safety violations and a reduced propensity to report safety oversights to supervisors. A high score on the \{BSRI\} masculinity scale was associated with a higher propensity to report safety oversights, while \{BSRI\} femininity was not associated with any of the safety measures. Conclusion Norm-based aspects of masculinity are suitable for analysing the association between masculinity and safety outcomes, whereas trait-based theories do not show strong associations with safety outcomes. Implications The association between norm-based masculinity and safety measures might be used in tailoring and developing new preventive measures that specifically address masculinity and male role norms. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The aim of this study was to establish the psychometric properties of the 11-item Brief Norwegian Safety Climate Inventory (Brief NORSCI) and to examine direct and indirect associations between shift work schedules, sleep problems, health complaints, and psychological safety climate. The study was based on a questionnaire survey in a randomly drawn cross-sectional sample of 8066 workers from the Norwegian offshore petroleum industry. The results showed that the Brief \{NORSCI\} has good psychometric properties. The three first order factors in the inventory could be combined in a composite second order safety climate factor with high construct and convergent validity. Workers on the different shift work schedules differed in levels of sleep problems and safety climate, but not with regard to health complaints. All non-day shift schedules reported significantly higher levels of sleep problems compared to day shift workers. Night shift workers had the most positive perceptions of safety. Shift work schedules had an indirect association with safety climate through sleep problems, but not through health complaints. These results provide tentative evidence for sleep problems as a potential explanatory factor in the shift work – psychological safety climate relationship. While this study has established the psychometric properties of the Brief NORSCI, as well as its relationships with shift work, health, and sleep, more research is needed in order to further determine the validity of the instrument. },

The goal of this study was to analyze different entities through different types of aggregation. The aggregated variables of micro-, meso- and macro-levels of the systems thinking approach were found to exert an effect on each other in the regression analysis. For \{OSH\} managers and workers’ \{OSH\} representatives, the Hypotheses were supported with the aggregated variables as follows: Hypothesis 1 – \{OSH\} management &amp; collaboration was positively related to training, measuring and monitoring, quality of \{OHC\} services and quality of \{OSH\} legislation; Hypothesis 2 – technical processes were positively related to training, measuring and monitoring, \{OSH\} management &amp; collaboration and quality of \{OSH\} legislation; Hypothesis 3 – measuring and monitoring were positively related to training, \{OSH\} management &amp; collaboration, quality of \{OHC\} services and quality of \{OSH\} legislation; Hypothesis 4 – instructions were positively related to training, measuring and monitoring, \{OSH\} management &amp; collaboration and quality of \{OHC\} services; and Hypothesis 5 – use of personal protective equipment was positively related to training, measuring and monitoring, \{OSH\} management &amp; collaboration, quality of \{OHC\} services and quality of \{OSH\} legislation. The functional specification related micro-, meso- and macro-levels revealed how one can apply a system approach model to demonstrate how the human, safety management, and organizational factors fit together in the broad safety context (e.g., \{OSH\} legislation). },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study aims to investigate psychological factors related to mode use on urban work/education and leisure travels, and to examine such factors related to intentions of using public transport. A survey was conducted in a random representative sample of the Norwegian population living in urban regions recruited from the Norwegian population registry (n = 1039). A two-cluster solution for mode use was revealed: individuals who mainly used public or health-promoting transport, and individuals who primarily used a car on the respective travels. The results suggest that car habit strength is more strongly related to car use on work/education travels. The probability component of risk perception was related to mode use on leisure travels, and there was a weak association between the consequence component and use. High perceived probability of accidents in public transport was associated with use of public transport, while high corresponding risk estimates in private motorized transport were associated with car use. Strong car habit strength and high perceived probabilities of accidents and security issues in public transport were related to a reduced intention of using public transport. Increased worry of private motorized transport and a high demand for risk mitigation related to public modes were associated with an increased intention to use public transport. Work/education travels could be more habitual than leisure travels. Risk perception may be a result of exposure to specific modes, rather than a predictor of mode use. Safety and security factors also appeared as more relevant for leisure travels than for work/education travels. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Pedestrian fatalities contribute substantially to the total road traffic fatality burden in developing countries. There are few comparative studies which have examined differences in attitudes and risk behaviour amongst pedestrians in such countries. Empirical studies regarding the role of cultural factors as precursors of such attitudes and behaviour are also scant. The aim of this study was to examine differences in attitudes towards pedestrian safety, risky pedestrian behaviour and cultural dimensions in samples of young adults (18–25 years) from Iran and Pakistan. We also tested a theoretical model where the cultural dimensions predicted risky pedestrian behaviour through attitudes towards pedestrian safety in the two samples. The results were based on a survey conducted amongst young adults from Iran (n = 131) and Pakistan (n = 161). The findings revealed that Iranians reported more transgression risk behaviour than the Pakistanis, whereas the latter reported substantially more attention violations and aggressive behaviour. Multi-group structural equation modelling showed that an unconstrained model was better fitted to the data than a constrained model. Vertical individualism was related to unsafe attitudes towards pedestrian safety in both countries, but more strongly in the Pakistani sample. Vertical collectivism was associated with safe pedestrian attitudes only in Iran. Male gender predicted more risk taking pedestrian behaviour in both countries, and safe attitudes predicted less risk taking pedestrian behaviour in both samples. Interventions aimed at reducing risky pedestrian behaviour amongst young adults in Pakistan and Iran may benefit by focusing on cultural factors in addition to enforcing traffic regulations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Efficient response to maritime incidents and accidents requires good communication processes and situation awareness by all involved parties, in particular between the Search and Rescue (SAR) response operators and the crew of the distressed vessel. In this paper, a method is proposed for enhancing the communication between the involved parties, by focusing on the safety status of the vessel. Borrowing ideas from well-established working methods in especially emergency medicine, the Vessel \{TRIAGE\} method has been established through a broad stakeholder consultation process. Its intended application is to assess and communicate whether a vessel can provide a safe environment for the people onboard. Using a set of threat factors and a four-level ship safety categorization, the method aims to establish a shared understanding of the nature of the distress situation, which in turn has implications for the operational focus of the \{SAR\} operators and vessel crew. An evaluation of the proposed method indicates a positive reception among various maritime stakeholders, suggesting that implementing the Vessel \{TRIAGE\} method in maritime \{SAR\} procedures may act as a useful tool to assist in the management of maritime distress situations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Australia’s aged population is growing, creating pressures on staffing in aged care services. Increasingly, culturally and linguistically diverse (CALD) workers are filling the workforce void. Due to language and cultural differences, and being new workers, \{CALD\} workers may experience difficulties in communication, increasing their risk of work-related injury and illness. However, our understanding of how \{CALD\} workers navigate health and safety as a work practice is limited. This study sought to reveal how \{CALD\} workers understand and communicate regarding their health and safety at work, and to identify mechanisms by which communication could be enhanced to benefit safety. We observed work practices over 57 shifts, examined documentation, and interviewed 51 workers and 22 residents in residential aged care. Field notes and interview data were transcribed, inductively coded and thematically analyzed to reveal themes related to communicating about work health and safety (WHS). The findings reveal that health and safety is a relational practice reliant on interactions between participants at the person–task–organization interface. Cultural identity also significantly affected \{CALD\} workers’ participation in health and safety communication. Particular attention needs to be given to overcoming reticence which limits effective communication between workers during daily work. Cultural as well as linguistic differences impact on the communication and participation of \{CALD\} workers in health and safety at work. Reticence and different practices for showing respect may impede \{CALD\} workers active participation. Solutions involve attention to training, job and management systems design with a focus on participation and inter-cultural awareness. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Working effectively requires judgement to balance risks while achieving work goals, one of which is safety. Existing occupational health and safety risk assessment theories compartmentalise hazards as discrete entities and treat the resultant risks objectively. This approach overly simplifies the nature of work, neglecting the interaction and reconciliation of rapidly changing task demands, individual and organisational factors, implying that risks remain fixed. Such an approach suggests a divide between theory and practice. This paper explores how this divide is managed in safety critical contexts where risk assessment must respond to the evolving nature of risk and workers must actively participate in managing it. We highlight the dynamic and adaptive nature of safety decision making as a skilful response to risk in complex environments, where workers apply a flexible boundary to their assessment and management of risk. Nurses from three Australian metropolitan hospitals were interviewed and provided stories about patient interactions in which they encountered a risk to their own safety. These stories were analysed thematically to identify how and what factors influenced nurses’ decisions. Results revealed that nurses applied a flexible boundary of risk assessment and management to balance patient and nurse needs, constantly re-evaluating their decisions to determine ‘safe enough’ strategies. Nurses used risk-based reasoning to determine this flexible boundary which may result in nurses’ health and safety being traded off to achieve patient priorities. These findings highlight that managing risk is dynamic and the risk assessment and decision strategies adopted are flexible in response to evolving demands. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper responds to the recent call in Safety Science for greater academic attention to voluntary corporate disclosure of occupational health and safety information. The study extends prior literature by focusing in detail on occupational injury performance measures provided publicly by Australia’s 50 largest listed firms. Content analysis of a sample of 239 annual reports issued between 1997 and 2009 revealed, as expected, firms in hazardous industries provided significantly higher rates of disclosure, in terms of both number of performance measures and frequency of reporting, than firms in less hazardous industries. Yet higher disclosure did not translate to adequate reporting on measures needed to demonstrate the prevention of serious injury. Instead, there was a strong reliance on variations of highly aggregated frequency rates often criticised in academic and practitioner safety literature. Further, evidence appeared to demonstrate strategic efforts to reduce the visibility of high-consequence safety system failures over time, thereby attenuating investor perceptions of occupational safety risk. The results provide important insights into the communication of corporate \{OHS\} performance to investors and suggest the presence of quantitative performance measures is not necessarily indicative of high quality disclosure. The findings also have important implications for the development of disclosure indices in future voluntary reporting research. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The vehicle travel velocity at the moment of pedestrian contact is considered to be an important parameter that affects the accident outcome. To reduce the vehicle-to-pedestrian travel velocity, a pedestrian detection system using a sensor in a vehicle could be an effective countermeasure. The specifications of the pedestrian detection system will need to be designed properly based on real-world accident situations. Then, the purpose of this study is to clarify the relation between vehicle travel velocity and pedestrian injury severity or fatality risk in traffic accident analyses in order to propose specifications of a pedestrian detection system. We analyzed the relation using the Institute for Traffic Accident Research and Data Analysis (ITARDA) database for 2009 in Japan, considering different factors including a vehicle type and pedestrian age in actual traffic accidents. The results indicate that the percentage risk of fatality was consistent between sedans and light passenger cars at every vehicle travel velocity, rising sharply at a vehicle travel velocity of 40 km/h. Meanwhile, in car-to-pedestrian accidents involving sedans and light passenger cars, pedestrians aged 60 and over faced the higher risk of fatality, which increased rapidly at the vehicle travel velocity of 40 km/h. Therefore, the present study proposes that the specifications of the pedestrian detection system should be designed so that the vehicle travel velocity in traffic accidents could be reduced to 30 km/h or lower, when we consider the decrease of fatality. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In general, it is important to understand drivers of safety performance. The issue of hydrocarbon leaks on offshore platforms is one of the most important safety performance indicators based on risk related to major accidents. In this study, a longitudinal design was used to investigate the relationships between work climate and hydrocarbon leaks from a broader organizational perspective. Confirmatory factor analyses tested on a sample of offshore workers (N = 3320), supported the validity of the Scandinavian Work Climate Instrument (SWCI). Complementary results also supported the measurement model. Pearson’s correlations indicated significant associations between work climate dimensions and hydrocarbon leaks occurring in the post survey period. All correlations were negative, supporting the proposed hypothesis. Generally, the results supported the assumption and model that guided the overall investigation. Specifically, work climate was associated with safety performance. The findings indicated that several work climate factors could function as leading indicators, implying that the work climate approach has been underestimated in safety research. Correlations with hydrocarbon leaks indicate that the organizational factors explored in this study can predict different levels of leaks. This suggests that the work climate approach used in this study represents an important contribution to achieving a holistic understanding of safety performance. Future research should replicate the study design in other settings and investigate the possibility of exploring relationships with other types of safety performance indicators using SWCI. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Three studies were conducted to develop and evaluate safety toolbox talks about fatal construction incidents. Study 1 surveyed workers (n = 28) about existing pre-shift meetings. An evidence-based structure for toolbox talks was developed, and study 2 evaluated our selected line drawing illustration format with workers (n = 30). Study 3 evaluated supervisors’ talks using: (1) new toolbox guides and (2) long-form investigation reports with workers from eight construction crews. In study 1, 25% of the sample reported never conducted safety meetings. In study 2, compared to photos, line drawings increased the distance workers’ could correctly identify hazards by over 1.5 m. In study 3, the new format was preferred by 82% of supervisors, saved them 15 min preparation/presentation time, and produced favorable impacts with workers. Brief scripted toolbox talks made it easier for supervisors to share fatal stories and prevention recommendations with their crews. When the format includes scripted text for the supervisors, prompts for discussion and action items, and line drawings worker understanding can be enhanced. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Serious incidents in the 1970s and continuous growth of factories producing and/or using hazardous substances formed the basis of a quantitative approach to risk. While discussions of risk were conducted in all industrialised countries they were particularly important in The Netherlands due to space limitations and short distances between industrial plants and residential areas. This article is part of a series covering the history of the safety science discipline (Swuste et al., 2015; Van Gulijk et al., 2009; Swuste et al., 2010). The concept risk entered the Dutch safety domain before the 1970s in relatively isolated case studies and in managing flood defences in The Netherlands. Since the 1970s these case studies paved the way for the development of mathematical models for quantitative risk analysis that were based on experience from nuclear power plants, the process industries and reliability engineering from operations research. ‘External safety’ was a focal point for these early developments in the process industries: adverse effects of dangerous goods outside the factory’s property boundaries. The models were documented in standardised textbooks for risk analysis in The Netherlands, the so-called ‘coloured books’. These works contributed to the development of the Seveso Directive. For internal safety (taking place within property boundaries) semi-quantitative approaches were developed simultaneously. The models for quantitative risk analysis were deemed reliable, but the acceptability of a quantified risk was another matter. Making decisions on risk relates to complex societal issues, such as ethics, stakeholder perception of risks, stakeholder involvement, and politics, all of which made the decision making process far from straightforward. With the introduction of the abstract concept of risk in the Dutch safety science domain, the question of risk perception became important in Dutch safety research. The concept risk and methods for quantitative risk analysis first entered into Dutch law in environmental risk regulations. It took a while for risk to be accepted by occupational safety experts, but just before the turn of the century ‘occupational risk inventory and evaluations’ or RI&amp;E methods were introduced into Dutch occupational safety legislation. This finalised the paradigm shift to risk-based safety-decision making in the Dutch safety science domain. While methods for quantifying risk are now widely applied and accepted, the proper use of risk perception and risk in the political decision process are still being debated. },

Reliability of \{SIS\} is measured by the analysis of probability of failure on demand (PFD) which is an integral part in quantitative risk and safety assessment to determine the risk and safety integrity level. \{PFD\} varies from location to location due to atmospheric effects. In this paper, new mathematical models are proposed to compute the failure probability of the equipment due to corrosion considering three atmospheric factors: temperature, humidity and wind speed. The models are solved by least squares methods using standard data to identify the parameters involved in the models. Finally, comparison between the two proposed models is made to select the better model for computing the failure probability. The models provide good correlation with reference data. These models can be used to compute the \{PFD\} at any geographical location. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Safety analysis in the companies is an important issue besides the quality, productivity and profitability. Safety integrity function in many industries is based on safety instrumented systems. Uncertainty is the main problem of safety analysis. In this paper, a new mathematical model is developed to compute the probability of failure on demand (PFD) following the three steps. First, \{KHALFI\} (Characteristics of Hazard Analysis based on Logic Frequency Initiative) mathematical model is formulated to identify the real \{PFD\} at any geographical location considering five intermediate factors: temperature, humidity, pressure, wind speed and time which can affect the PFD. Second, probability binary state (PROBIST) is used to precise the values of PFD. Third, Bowtie method is employed to carry out the safety analysis for examining the safety of some scenarios by determining the \{PFD\} of safeguards, where new classification for the safety integrity level is proposed. Finally, Simulink model is developed implementing the proposed model to facilitate the automatic computation and analysis. Results indicate that all the atmospheric elements are significant and need to be taken into consideration to attain the best reliability in the calculation of PFD. The effectiveness of the proposed model gives the opportunity for the analysts to conduct safety analysis at any geographical location. },

The adverse impacts of this on driver safety requires further insight to determine the mechanisms involved in distraction and countermeasures to mitigate it. Contemporary approaches highlight the need to move away from individualistic strategies in distraction mitigation, towards a systems perspective that accounts for the road transport system as a whole. This paper applied grounded theory to identify five key factors of distraction and their relationships that were incorporated into the Priority, Adapt, Resource, Regulate, Conflict (PARRC) systems model of driver distraction. Applying this model to a case study suggests how taking a systems perspective to the phenomenon may hold elements within the wider road transport system responsible for distraction incidents. This opens up the potential for countermeasures higher up in the causal chain of events. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Responding to an emergency alarm poses a significant risk to firefighters’ health and safety, particularly to cardiovascular health, physical and psychological stress, and fatigue. These risks have been largely categorised for salaried firefighters working ‘on station’. Less is known about the factors that contribute to these risks for the vast number of non-salaried personnel who serve in retained roles, often deploying from home. The present study investigated the alarm response procedure for Australian metropolitan fire fighters, identifying common and divergent sources of risk for salaried and retained staff. There were significant differences in procedure between the two workgroups and this resulted in differences in risk profile between groups. Sleep and fatigue, actual response to the alarm stimulus, work-life balance and trauma emerged as sources of risk experienced differently by salaried and retained firefighters. Key findings included reports of fatigue in both groups, but particularly in the case of retained firefighters who manage primary employment as well as their retained position. This also translated into a poor sense of work-life balance. Both groups reported light sleep, insufficient sleep or fragmented sleep as a result of alarm response. In the case of salaried firefighters, this was associated with being woken on station when other appliances are called. There were risks from physical and psychological responses to the alarm stimulus, and reports of sleep inertia when driving soon after waking. The findings of this study highlight the common and divergent risks for these workgroups, and could be used in the ongoing management of firefighters’ health and safety. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper aims to explore pedestrian temporal and spatial gap acceptance at uncontrolled mid-block street crossings, where vehicles do not yield to pedestrians and pedestrians have to choose safe gap on their own. This results in complex interactions between pedestrians and vehicles. Analyzing the interactions is important from both safety and performance evaluation of pedestrian crossings. The paper reports the applicability and generality of driver’s gap acceptance models to the pedestrian’s gap acceptance. Temporal and spatial critical gaps are estimated using both deterministic (Raff’s and Ashworth’s method) as well as probabilistic approaches (Maximum Likelihood method and Logit method). The data collected using video camera at two uncontrolled marked mid-block crossings resulted in 1107 lag/gap observations. The analysis found that (a) temporal and spatial gaps follow lognormal distribution, (b) speed of the conflicting vehicle has significant effect on the spatial gap acceptance, (c) critical gap values by deterministic methods are smaller than those by probabilistic methods, (d) temporal and spatial critical gaps by different methods vary between 3.6–4.3 s and 60–73 m respectively. These values are much lower than the widely accepted values calculated using \{HCM\} 2010. The analysis can be used in developing methodologies for safety and level of service evaluation of uncontrolled pedestrian crossings. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract With the rapid rise of the use of mobile phones worldwide, the traffic safety experts have considered effects of mobile phone use on pedestrian crossing behaviour. This study sought to find out how the use of mobile phones (talking, texting and listening to music) affects the behaviour of pedestrians while they are crossing the street. Using field observation the data have been collected concerning the demographic characteristics and behaviour of the pedestrians from the target group (the pedestrians who use mobile phones) and from the demographic-matched and time-matched control group (the pedestrians who did not use mobile phones). For predicting the unsafe types of behaviour the logistic regression models were constructed and it included the next predictor variables: gender, age, number of accompanying pedestrians, the manner of using mobile phones and location of intersection. The results of the research have shown that the pedestrians who use mobile phones while crossing the street behave less safely than the pedestrians who do not use mobile phones and that their safety depends on the way they use mobile phones. Mobile phone talking has the greatest effect on the unsafe behaviour of pedestrians; texting/viewing content on mobile phone also influences the pedestrians’ behaviour though less than speaking, while listening to music has the smallest impact. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A survey was conducted of 275 pedestrians in a nocturnal urban environment in the city of Granada (Spain). The objective was to evaluate user perceptions of the impact of different kinds of public lighting on perceived safety from criminal actions and on general well-being (avoidance of stress, glare, headaches, etc.). As part of the study, average illuminance was also measured in each street to detect potential correlations between survey data, illumination levels, and color of light. The results of this study indicate that well illuminated streets (that is, where lighting is uniform) with higher illuminance levels, tend to make people feel safer and better. This marked preference for more light is now less of a drawback because modern \{LED\} lighting permits higher levels of illuminance with low electricity consumption. It was also found that, besides the lower economic and environmental impact of High Pressure Sodium (HPS) lighting, stemming from the significant reduction in light pollution, the results generally indicated a better performance of this kind of lighting. However, despite the fact that white light could lead to higher levels of light pollution, it seemed to make people feel safer. These facts should be seriously considered by lighting engineers, urban planners, and city administrators when making difficult decisions about the design of lighting installations. },

The diary data highlight the propensity for problem-fixing in a single-loop learning mode rather than deeper, double-loop learning problem-resolution. The latter occurs amongst those with organizational responsibility for safety, irrespective of hierarchical position. The observation of violations is suggestive of prior learning of correct procedures and these data suggest that near-misses are under-reported in organizations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Safety leadership is asserted to positively influence safety compliance amongst employees. We examine this assertion by conducting a systematic literature review of the available academic literature on safety leadership practices and observed safety outcomes. We identified 25 empirical studies, the majority of which measured leadership through generic scales (MLQ and LMX). Closer scrutiny of the outcome measures suggested that these were mainly aligned to the implementation and operations phases of the \{OHSAS\} 18001 safety management systems framework. We conclude that safety compliance has been narrowly defined in academic study, but in practice embraces a much wider range of activities. While safety leadership may contribute to successfully achieving these other actions, there is no empirical evidence for this. Moreover, there is considerable critique of transformational and transactional leadership, so that the specification of desired leadership practices is problematic. We propose that a broader conceptualization of safety compliance requires safety leadership to embrace ‘plural’ forms of leadership. We draw attention to the narrow range of contexts in which safety leadership has been empirically studied and suggest other settings for investigation. Alternative methods for investigating safety leadership other than scales of leadership behaviour are suggested to enrich our understanding of safety leadership and so improve safety compliance. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In order to highlight the strengths and weaknesses of land use planning and emergency panning policies and strategies in EU, the Italian regulations and guidelines are used as example to discuss the distance between the European and national regulation and the disaster management and post-disaster procedures, that together with the land use planning are often conceived for a Municipal scale. Both anthropic and natural risks are dealt with in the emergency planning, but risk information derive from very diverse sources, with different levels of detail – from the risk assessment of major risk plants to the representation of risks provided by sectorial plans, each one focused on a single type of risk (i.e. flood, seismic, fire…). Emergency plans should aim at correlating the various risk evaluations, thus being able to provide a comprehensive emergency programme, both for people and territorial safety, but indeed the land use is often regulated by a completely different legislation and designing system. This lack of linkage between the procedures for Emergency and for Land Use Planning makes the emergency management less effective towards the achievement of a real safety of territories, as proved by recent disastrous events in the European territory. In order to solve these critical issues, the paper aims at providing hints on how to achieve a different approach both in land use and emergency planning, conceiving risk assessment as part of an integrated process composed by many important and interrelated phases, not only post-disaster emergency, but also structural interventions for the long-term prevention. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Machines pose various types of hazards and exposure to these hazards can result in injury or death. Risks linked to machinery can be managed by controlling hazardous energies. Safety procedures are thus used to control hazardous energies on machinery when workers perform different tasks such as maintenance, unjamming, or repair work. These procedures are part of a safety management policy for hazardous energies. The policy is described in a document referred to as the lockout program, which includes activities and work targeted by lockout, audits, hazard identification, training, communication and so on. The objective of this paper is to understand how the lockout program is actually implemented. As such, seven lockout programs from eight sawmills were analyzed. Twenty-two interviews were conducted with machine operators, maintenance workers and managers to gain a better understanding of the actual application of lockout programs, identify weak points and propose improvements. Fifty-seven lockout procedures were also observed. It was found that (i) hazard identification was incomplete, (ii) lockout program signatures and dates were missing, (iii) actual lockout practices were better than the procedures described in the programs regarding lockout hardware, rules to observe when using lockout hardware (e.g. keeping keys in one’s possession at all times) and machinery design for facilitating lockout, (iv) locks were applied to control systems during minor unjamming contrary to lockout principles, and (v) permits were issued as alternatives to lockout for troubleshooting without risk assessment. In actual fact, risk assessment is needed for both interventions requiring lockout and those without lockout. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Organizations often direct considerable attention toward the identification and assessment of the various risks associated with hazardous process operations, and as part of their risk control system they typically rely on written procedures for guiding workers in carrying out the necessary task activities. However, these procedures can, in and of themselves, serve as sources of risk, which strongly suggests the need for methods that could enable organizations to efficiently assess the risks potentially intrinsic to their written procedures. This paper focuses on the identification, understanding, and modeling of the risks potentially associated with written work procedures. The idea of controls within procedures and a taxonomy of procedures based on the nature of a procedure’s controls are first presented. This is followed by a systematic reappraisal of the risks resident in written procedures that are incurred through the processes of development and management of procedures by organizations. The focus then shifts to the implications for an organization’s risk control system of behavioral variability associated with carrying out procedures. This leads to the presentation of a proposed modeling framework intended for translation or adaptation by organizations as a practical means for assessing what is referred to as “procedure risk”—the risk resident in procedures. Key concepts that are emphasized in this framework are the value of a procedural control and the likelihood of failure of a procedural control. Guidance is provided concerning a possible way for instantiating the modeling framework through a case study involving space shuttle ground processing operations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the last two years Australia has seen a step-change in Occupational Health and Safety (OHS) professional education with the implementation of the \{OHS\} regulator-funded \{OHS\} Body of Knowledge project. This project resulted in the development and publication of the \{OHS\} Body of Knowledge, accreditation of university-level \{OHS\} professional education and certification of \{OHS\} professionals and practitioners. The \{OHS\} Body of Knowledge for Generalist \{OHS\} Professionals was first published in 2012 and work is ongoing. The \{OHS\} Body of Knowledge is achieving recognition within Australia and internationally. Professional accreditation for university level \{OHS\} education was introduced in 2012. Coincidentally, accreditation of \{OHS\} professional education has been implemented at the same time as structural changes in the quality standards for universities and changes in the Australian Qualification Framework presenting significant opportunities. Commencing with a brief description of the rationale, development and implementation of the \{OHS\} Body of Knowledge project this paper focuses on the \{OHS\} Body of Knowledge itself and accreditation of \{OHS\} professional education. The paper provides a discussion on competence compared with capability. It then examines the impact of recent Australian government initiatives, the \{OHS\} Body of Knowledge and accreditation, on capability and draws on the results of accreditation assessments to describe the impact on \{OHS\} education. The paper concludes with an evaluation of the contribution of the \{OHS\} Body of Knowledge and program accreditation to the capability outcomes of the Australian Work Health and Safety Strategy for 2012–22 with an extrapolation to potential lessons for other countries. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Regional human exposure to the hazard is an important basis of decision support for more efficient and effective emergency management especially pre-event. Due to the diverse locations of human activities and the displacements they induce, the spatial distribution of population is inhomogeneous and strongly time-dependent. Hence, in the present work, land use pattern was introduced to reflect the distribution characteristics of human exposure in hazard affected regions both in daytime and nighttime. Human activities that contribute to spatial distribution variance were considered to establish the correlation between human types and land-use patterns at a regional scale. Furthermore, hypergraph was used to model the regional human exposure in order to benefit the analysis of spatial–temporal distribution characteristics of population, and variance algorithms for disaggregating different styles of human to the regional land were constructed. What’s more, the model was applied to the analysis of potential human exposure in the built district of Dalian City. Results show that a great amount of area and population are beyond moderate exposure levels on urban construction land of Dalian City, and the population potentially exposed significantly increases from nighttime to daytime periods, especially in the zones with diverse human activities. The presented approach in this study can not only be of utmost importance for vulnerability assessment or risk evaluation, but also for regional and environmental planning as well as local development. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Although mind wandering as a cognitive distraction is universal in our daily driving, very few studies have focused on the impact of mind wandering on driving behavior. In this study, the relationship between mind wandering during everyday life and dangerous driving behavior was investigated. 295 drivers completed the Mind Wandering scale (MW), the Dula Dangerous Driving Index (DDDI), and Demographic questionnaire. The results showed that the frequency of mind wandering was positively correlated with risky driving, aggressive driving, negative cognitive/emotional driving and drunk driving as measured by the DDDI. In addition, drivers’ mind wandering was also positively correlated with self-reported traffic accidents, penalty points and fines. Moreover, the interaction effects of mind wandering and gender on dangerous driving behavior were also explored. In the high mind wandering group, male drivers reported more risky and negative emotional driving behaviors than did female drivers, but there were no significant differences in the middle and low mind wandering groups. Also, male drivers reported more penalty points and fines, but were involved in fewer accidents than were female drivers. These results present considerable implications for road safety and strategies for self-regulation of mind wandering. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Continuation of organizations’ key processes in the aftermath of disasters plays an important role in the different businesses. The business continuity management (BCM) is a new concept which has attracted a lot of attention in the last decade and the most renowned organizations in the world use \{BCM\} as an effective precautionary approach to mitigate the consequences of disasters and making them resilient against disruptions. Alongside BCM, insuring and outsourcing are two other ways for coping with disasters. This study presents a novel framework for analyzing these three strategies (i.e. BCM, outsourcing and insuring) by which the best one can be selected according to the organization’s characteristics and relevant data. Furthermore, the study aims to elaborate on the interrelationships between the organization’s desirable continuity level in terms of recovery time objective (RTO) and recovery point objective (RPO) indicators, and the chosen approach to response disastrous situations. For this, all of the cost and benefits of each approach are considered and based on the type of organization for which a cost–benefit analysis is done. Economic factors such as the current and the future values as well as inflation rate are taken into account to select the best possible response strategy. As there is inherent uncertainty in input data, this study proposes a fuzzy based method to capture the impreciseness of data in the form of triangular fuzzy numbers. The proposed methodology is implemented on a numerical example to show its applicability. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Safety and health at work (SHW) has become a public health priority in industrialized countries and a primary concern in the context of human resource management and in particular high risk-industries. Thus, developing a strong safety culture (SC) would be a mean to reduce the number of adverse events related to various activities in the company. Now, the laws and customs interact: when a people have good manners, laws become simple. Unfortunately, habits cannot be modified by setting example. Therefore, regardless of the size and activity of the entity, health and safety at work must be at the heart of its daily management. In the absence of effective management of health and safety at work, it is the entire company that is mismanaged. On the whole, risk management can be defined as a process of prevention and protection allowing a company or an entity, placed in a competitive context, to take all necessary decisions in order to optimize its activity, without affecting its customers as well as the environment. This work is an opportunity to initiate a global approach to prevention in cement plants whose purpose is to improve working conditions by technical, organizational and human solutions to improve the health and safety of employees while engaging in a process of continuous improvement. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Despite the Pakistani construction industry’s recent rapid growth and development, workers are still working in poor safety conditions. While Pakistan has several occupational safety and health laws, they are too broad to be applied directly to the construction industry. Due to the presence of a weak regulatory system, worker safety is not a principal focus of the construction industry. This paper presents a case study that was conducted to help improve the existing construction safety situation in Pakistan by developing a framework for better implementation of safety practices and thus bridging the safety related perceptual gaps between the different stakeholders and regulatory authorities. The proposed safety framework is composed of guidelines for a reciprocal safety implementation system with aspects such as regulatory enhancements and corporate safety culture improvements. The framework was analyzed using the Delphi method and priorities were defined as rated/ranked by a panel of Pakistani construction safety experts. The emphasis of this framework is to expend all possible efforts to minimize the safety risks for construction workers through stronger regulations and voluntary compliance efforts by all the stakeholders. This case study can serve as a model for other developing countries to further develop and improve their construction safety environment. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In technical systems like oil and gas drilling systems, an accident sequence starts with an Initiating Event (IE) and evolves over time through the interaction of barriers in terms of success or failure. As it has been dramatically demonstrated in a variety of cases, offshore oil rigs activities have severe consequences to people, asset, environment and reputation. A survey carried out on a leakage event in production phase. The barriers of the above \{IE\} are assessed by Event Tree Analysis (ETA) which evaluates the sequence of events in a potential accident scenario following the occurrence of an IE. In this research to calculate Failure Probability (FP) of barriers new approach is proposed. In this methodology, Reliability Block Diagram (RBD) and Fault Tree Analysis (FTA) are employed to quantify barriers FP. \{RBD\} is useful tool to quantify \{FP\} of barriers with logic diagram. \{FP\} of barriers with logic diagram is obtained by FTA. However it is often difficult to estimate precisely the \{FP\} of the components due to insufficient data. It has been reported that availability of the \{FP\} data pertaining to local conditions is surprisingly limited. In this study to overcome this problem using of expert judgment and then fuzzy logic is employed. Therefore, Fuzzy \{FTA\} (FFTA) is used to reduce uncertainty of expert judgment. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Traffic crash fatalities from 2006 to 09 in Delhi, India show that pedestrians have the largest share in total road fatalities. Perception of risk provides important information to identify potential crash risk. Thus, the main objective of this paper is to explore the pedestrian perception of risk in getting involved in a traffic crash in different locations and the role of built environment features in risk perception of pedestrians. Locations having a high number of pedestrian fatal crashes were identified using \{GIS\} map of Delhi. Pedestrian perceptions of risk at forty-five actual crash sites were collected through questionnaire survey. Risk perception of pedestrians of built environment features were analyzed based on pedestrian demographic characteristics. Ordered logit model was used to examine the influence of these variables on risk perception of respondent’s neighborhood and of the location where the survey was conducted. Seventy percent respondents perceive the neighborhoods where they reside having higher risk than the actual crash locations. Several factors such as gender, number of lanes, sidewalk width, sidewalk maintenance, traffic speed and traffic volume were significantly associated with perceived risk. Survey sites were further categorized into four groups i.e. foot of flyover, four-way junctions below flyover, midblocks and intersections to find the impact of characteristics of locations on pedestrians’ risk perception of different locations. Four-way junctions below flyover were found to have higher perceived risk compared to other locations. },

To achieve this, we perform the head posture estimation with a range camera using Random Forests algorithm. Utilizing the head posture information and the point cloud data of the construction equipment, we generate dynamic blindspots or visibility maps from the operators perspective in real-time.

The aim of this study was to (1) use a participatory process to develop a rig to support pneumatic rock drills or large electric hammer drills in order to reduce the health risks and (2) evaluate the usability of the rig. Seven prototype rigs for supporting large hammer drills were developed and modified with feedback from commercial contractors and construction workers. The final design was evaluated by laborers and electricians (N = 29) who performed their usual concrete drilling with the usual method and the new rig. Subjective regional fatigue was significantly less in the neck, shoulders, hands and arms, and lower back when using the universal rig compared to the usual manual method. Usability ratings for the rig were significantly better than the usual method on stability, control, drilling, accuracy, and vibration. Drilling time was reduced by approximately 50% with the rig. Commercial construction contractors, laborers and electricians who use large hammer drills for drilling many holes should consider using such a rig to prevent musculoskeletal disorders, fatigue, and silicosis. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Fishing is one of the most dangerous occupations in the world. In addition to the high risk of fatality, fish harvesters are also at risk of a wide range of non-fatal injuries during their work at sea. Weather factors are an intrinsic part of fish harvesters’ operating environment and they consider the most dangerous situations at sea to be associated with weather-related factors. This research aims to answer questions regarding the effects of extratropical cyclone weather conditions on the severity level of maritime incidents to provide more insight for fish harvesters and/or marine traffic decision makers such as the Canadian Coast Guard. To achieve these goals, weather and incident data in Atlantic Canadian waters were matched spatially and temporally then analyzed to explore their relationships. Logistic Regression was used to examine how weather factors affect the severity level of fishing vessel incidents. Ice concentration, wind speed, sea surface temperature, and darkness were the most significant environmental factors with respect to severity level of fishing incidents. When only incidents associated with cyclones were taken into consideration, Laplacian of pressure as an indicator of cyclone’s intensity replaced ice concentration as a significant factor. Logistic Regression was also applied for individual fishery types, revealing that distinct fisheries can be affected by different weather factors. Improving our understanding of extreme events and revising safety related policies in commercial fishing is particularly important under climate change scenarios as fish harvesters’ reliance on traditional weather patterns becomes increasingly questionable. },

We present an approach to show the predominance of human factors as an accident cause, as well as existing methodologies for \{HEP\} determination and their deficiencies in incorporating socio-technical elements that influence them. Such elements are: inappropriate design, training, procedures, communication, safety culture, management in the production process changes, emergency planning, accident investigation, environmental factors, maintenance workload and human–system interface. A mathematical model is proposed to incorporate these elements taking into account their contribution weights as well as measuring their degree of implementation in the plant. This creates a factor that can modify existing HEPs, giving values that better reflect plant reality. The model was applied to the accident that occurred in 1999 in Tokai-Mura, Japan. The modified \{HEP\} was 2 times greater than the nominal HEP. This shows that considering organizational factors thoroughly allows for a more realistic plant behavior modeling in face of abnormal events. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This exploratory study sought to identify the factors important to large improvement in workplace occupational health and safety (OHS) performance. Mixed methods were used to systematically identify 12 organizations in a workers’ compensation database that had made large and intentional improvement in workplace \{OHS\} performance in Ontario, Canada, during 1998–2008 (i.e., “breakthrough change” (BTC) cases). Four of these organizations were selected for in-depth case study (two manufacturers, a grocery and a social agency). Cross-case analysis and consideration of existing literature led to a 12-element conceptual model with organizational learning at its core. Four elements were involved in the initiation of BTC: external influence, organizational motivation to improve OHS, new \{OHS\} knowledge and a knowledge transformation leader. Five other elements were involved in the process of BTC: responsiveness to \{OHS\} concerns, positive social dynamics, continuous improvement pattern, simultaneous operational improvement, and supportive internal context. Finally, three elements are outcomes of BTC: integrated \{OHS\} knowledge, decreased \{OHS\} risk, and decreased injury and illness. These concepts can be used in future research regarding workplace improvement in \{OHS\} performance. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractIntroduction There is a growing body of work regarding alcohol use and the workplace. However, little work has been conducted on risk factors for alcohol use in male-dominated industries. Method A systematic review of risk factors for alcohol use in male-dominated industries was undertaken. A male-dominated industry was defined as an industry comprising predominantly male workers (i.e. ⩾70%). This included agriculture, construction, mining, manufacturing, transport, and utilities industries. Searches were undertaken of major electronic databases (CINAHL, Cochrane Library, Informit, PsycINFO, PubMed and Scopus), the grey literature, and reference lists of retrieved papers for English language studies published between January 1990 and June 2012. Results Eighteen studies met the inclusion criteria. Most were cross-sectional in design. Methodological quality was assessed as moderate in nine studies and weak in the remainder. Factors associated with risky alcohol use were categorised into seven domains: demographic (being male, middle age), individual (depressed, negative life events), social norms at work (permissive drinking norms), work conditions (high workloads and job stress, low collegial support), team environment (supervisory abuse), work-home interference (using alcohol to unwind after work), and structural/socio-economic (lower \{SES\} workers), with some attenuation by income and other \{SES\} factors. Conclusion Alcohol primary prevention strategies and future research that targets specific high risk industries are warranted to address workplace drinking norms, reduce job workloads and stress, and improve workplace support. Multi-pronged, tailored strategies are needed in male-dominated industries that reflect the needs of high risk groups as well as targeting environmental, social, and contextual factors. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The use of appropriate acceptance criteria in the risk assessment process for occupational accidents is an important issue but often overlooked in the literature, particularly when new risk assessment methods are proposed and discussed. In most cases, there is no information on how or by whom they were defined, or even how companies can adapt them to their own circumstances. Bearing this in mind, this study analysed the problem of the definition of risk acceptance criteria for occupational settings, defining the quantitative acceptance criteria for the specific case study of the Portuguese furniture industrial sector. The key steps to be considered in formulating acceptance criteria were analysed in the literature review. By applying the identified steps, the acceptance criteria for the furniture industrial sector were then defined. The Cumulative Distribution Function (CDF) for the injury statistics of the industrial sector was identified as the maximum tolerable risk level. The acceptable threshold was defined by adjusting the \{CDF\} to the Occupational, Safety &amp; Health (OSH) practitioners’ risk acceptance judgement. Adjustments of acceptance criteria to the companies’ safety cultures were exemplified by adjusting the Burr distribution parameters. An example of a risk matrix was also used to demonstrate the integration of the defined acceptance criteria into a risk metric. This work has provided substantial contributions to the issue of acceptance criteria for occupational accidents, which may be useful in overcoming the practical difficulties faced by authorities, companies and experts. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractObjective The aim of this study was to evaluate the possibility of enhancing the visibility of motorcycles and pedestrians for motorists via safety messages concerning the vulnerability of these road users. Background In several cases of collision between cars and vulnerable road users (VRU), car drivers failed to detect the latter in time to avoid collision because of their low conspicuity. Method 2 groups of 17 motorists (23.6 years old) carried out a \{VRU\} detection task in 2 sessions in a car-driving simulator after either watching or not watching a film presenting safety messages about the vulnerability of these road users. Participants had to detect pedestrians and motorcyclists standing at the road side or who appeared on different parts of the road. Results The group of motorists who watched the film detected these \{VRUs\} at a greater distance and drove safely in zones which constitute a high risk of collision for pedestrians (key areas). Only the intensity of anger felt after the film can explain the improvement in \{VRU\} visibility distance. Moreover, this improvement was also associated with a modification in speed management in key areas. This last result provides evidence of the importance of top down processes in the detection of \{VRUs\} by motorists. Conclusion The film enhanced \{VRU\} visibility and led to safer driving behaviour for pedestrians. Application The practical implications of these results for safety campaigns and future directions of research on the emotional states of motorists and their perception during driving are considered. Short abstract We examine motorists’ ability to detect motorcycles and pedestrians (VRUs) in a simulated car-driving task after watching a film presenting safety messages about \{VRU\} vulnerability. Informed motorists detect \{VRU\} sooner and drive in a safer way for pedestrians. We also consider practical implications and futures lines of research related to safety campaigns. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractIntroduction In the past few years much progress has been made in European Union in recognizing the importance of the work-related stress risk, and in adopting specific measures to assess such type of risk. In Italy, the legislative framework on occupational health and safety confirmed the obligation to assess the risk for work-related stress, according to the European Framework Agreement. Material and methods The Italian Workers’ Compensation Authority developed a methodology for the assessment of work related-stress risk as an integrated management risk approach comprising two main assessment tools: a checklist for measuring objective and observational risk indicators and a validated questionnaire to collect employees’ perceptions. This study aimed to explore the convergence degree among the results of the two assessment tools in a sample of 137 companies. Results By applying the univariate \{ANOVA\} the mean values of the questionnaire were compared to the levels of risk obtained in the preliminary assessment. The analyses highlighted that when the risk is higher in the preliminary assessment, there is an increase in the perceptions of the risk factors. In line with Cohen’s methodological guidelines findings revealed moderate values. Finally, the analysis of discrepancies shows a good concordance level among the results of the two assessment phases. Conclusions The study highlighted the effectiveness and reliability of the INAIL’s methodology. Such process enables companies to use two complementary tools for a more complete definition of the risk factors, in order to develop interventions. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Incident reporting is usually considered as an effective means to improve the safety of “at risk” socio-technical systems (e.g. nuclear plants, large industrial facilities, hospitals), as it allows implicated actors to learn from past incidents. Safety could thus be enhanced via the use of an institutionalized Incident Reporting System (IRS), enabling organizations to improve the quality of actions and reactions in case of a deviation from normality, or to prevent such deviations from happening in the first place. Yet, there is a lack of inductive analyses of actual, on-site uses of IRS. In this paper, we address this gap, using the results of 28 semi-structured interviews conducted with agents from the Belgian Nuclear Research Center (SCK·CEN). The study relies on a vulnerability-oriented Science and Technology Studies (STS) approach. Our results show that practices of incident reporting are more varied than the institutionalized ones. Indeed, actual reporting practices are to be related to specific expressions of solidarity between colleagues within a negotiated drift – a pragmatic interpretation of the reporting procedure. These results are discussed in a vulnerability-oriented perspective. Overall, the paper displays a grounded analysis of incident reporting practices which may contribute to a better understanding of how safety is co-constructed by workers, and provides opportunities for further research and concrete path of actions for practitioners. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The behaviour-based approach has been widely used to develop interventions for construction accident prevention. The actual effects of such interventions, however, often do not meet expectation or have only a short-term effect. Recent studies look beyond the immediate accident circumstances to shed light on systemic factors that lead to accidents. The authors present an institutional analysis of construction accident causality through investigation of heat illness cases on construction sites. Heat illness is a special type of incident in which the individual is both the victim and, to a certain extent, the agent. Its consequence can be fatal, but its spread to uninvolved personnel is limited. Like other construction accidents, it affects individuals but cannot be effectively managed without addressing the risks embedded in the institutional environment of the system in which the individual is situated. This provides a simplified event for identifying institutional factors affecting construction accident causation at different systems levels in construction projects. The analysis is based on 216 individual construction workers’ cases from 29 construction sites, including 36 reported critical incidents of heat illness cases. These are triangulated with data from site observation, interviews with managers and field notes of stakeholders’ meetings. Institutional factors that contribute to proactive and reactive behavioural intervention of heat illness development are identified at eight levels of systems. The findings can be used in guiding accident investigation, developing effective interventions and identifying improvement opportunities for stakeholders at different levels of systems related to a construction project. },

Two experiments showed emergency response team members’ degree of shared beliefs (measured as a ‘similarity index’) to be associated with which team they are in, but not with which position they have in the team. This indicates that factors specific to the teams, e.g. the leader’s behavior, the team’s shared experience, or communication patterns, are important for a team’s situation awareness. In the second experiment, task complexity was manipulated with a scripted scenario design and heart rate variability was measured as an indicator of executive function. Shared beliefs were shown to be associated with the degree of high frequency modulation of heart rate variability. Further, shared beliefs were associated with the designed task complexity for some teams. The experiments showed no association between the measure of shared beliefs and subjective reports of situation awareness. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study examined accident reports (n = 23) for collisions between attendant vessels and offshore facilities on the Norwegian continental shelf during the period of 2001–2011. An initial analysis indicated that the concept of situation awareness (SA) might be useful for providing a more detailed understanding of the processes that lead to collisions. \{SA\} is defined as ‘being aware of what is happening around you and understanding what that information means to you now and in the future’ (Endsley, 2012, p. 13). The first part of the study contains an analysis of accident reports that reveals that the collisions with offshore facilities were preceded by loss of \{SA\} on the bridge in 18 of the 23 instances. Three types of \{SA\} errors were identified: failure to perceive the situation correctly (Level 1 SA; n = 13), failure to comprehend the situation (Level 2 SA; n = 4), and failure to project the situation into the future (Level 3 SA; n = 1). In the second part of the study, the human, technological and organisational factors described in the accident reports are analysed to evaluate how the factors may have affected the duty officers‘ awareness of the situation. The results indicate that inadequate operation planning, inadequate bridge design, insufficient training, communication failures and distracting elements were the underlying factors that significantly contributed to the collisions. },

Furthermore the objective of the \{SPIs\} will be limited to safety management. One issue in using the \{SPIs\} is to determine the weightage of each SPI. The paper attempts to discuss this issue and provides guidelines to obtain weighting factors (WF) for the SPIs. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study introduces a new reward system for enhancing safety during work activities, by improving workers’ motivation in performance and thereby reducing occupational accidents. The reward system is based on a safety incentive that can be defined by means of two parameters: the worker behavior, which is measured especially in terms of proactivity (namely workers’ attitude in reporting potentially hazardous situations) and the consequences that could be avoided thanks to the reporting activity. In doing this, the fuzzy logic theory can be usefully applied, because it offers the opportunity to quantify the two parameters taking into account their vagueness, through the concept of degree of membership and then it also allows to combine them into the final value of the safety incentive through a Fuzzy Inference System (FIS). The model, named “Proactivity-and-Consequence Based Safety Incentive” (PCBSI), has been tested in an Italian chemical plant, with the purpose to evaluate its effectiveness. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the present study we have examined how the European chemicals regulation Registration, Evaluation, Authorisation and Restriction of Chemicals (REACH) has influenced occupational risk management of chemicals at Swedish downstream user companies. The data were collected through interviews with occupational health and safety professionals, safety representatives and authority employees. The results show that most of the informants had scarce knowledge about \{REACH\} and that \{REACH\} implementation has not had any major impacts on downstream users’ occupational risk management, but the impacts the regulation has had were perceived as positive. For instance, clear substance identification and increased hazard information were appreciated improvements of safety data sheets (SDS). However, with regards to identifying how to safely use a substance or product neither the \{SDSs\} nor the attached exposure scenarios were perceived as sufficient. \{REACH\} was not perceived as a major driver for substitution but has had some impact on substitution, either by requiring it for certain substances as through the authorisation procedure or facilitating the identification of relevant substances to substitute as more information on hazards has become available. The obstacles to \{REACH\} implementation are similar to those of occupational health and safety legislation; lack of awareness, understanding and/or incentives to take action. Especially smaller companies with their limited resources lag behind. Reaching the full potential of \{REACH\} requires more work on motivating and supporting downstream users to fulfil their \{REACH\} obligations. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract High-level, long-lived radioactive waste remains hazardous for periods that go well beyond our human conception of time (many thousands of years). Because active safety measures are considered unreliable, unjustifiable and simply impossible over such long time spans, experts worldwide recommend geological disposal as the preferred strategy for long-term radioactive waste management, to a large extent due to its promise of delivering ‘passive safety’. Passive safety refers to the repository being safe ‘by itself’, i.e. unmediated by human actors and actions. Safety is thus approached technically and delineated as an intrinsic property of the disposal system. As such, the notion of ‘passive safety’ entails a system simplification that allows for approaching safety in a more calculable and predictable manner than would be the case for ‘active safety’. In this article, we describe and analyze the ambiguity of this seemingly straightforward approach to safety. Drawing on constructivist insights from safety science and science and technology studies, we propose a more integrated sociotechnical vision that transcends the active versus passive safety division. The notion of ‘oversight’, as it is currently starting to surface in international radioactive waste management discourses, will be used as a sensitizing concept, offering potential to elaborate such an integrated vision. },

Domestic and international disaster-related reports indicate that temporary workers have high risk associated with working environments as a major cause of accidents. We established relationships between the individual and organizational factors that affect temporary workers’ safety behaviors using structural equation modeling (SEM). \{SEM\} is used to estimate simultaneously the cause-and-effect relationships between many independent variables and dependent variables. A questionnaire was administered to temporary construction workers, and the following results were obtained. First, personal characteristics had a partial effect on job stress and a direct effect on safety culture. Second, personal characteristics and job stress had a direct effect on self-perceived fatigue. Third, personal characteristics and safety culture had a direct effect on safety climate, and personal characteristics also had an indirect effect. Finally, personal characteristics had no direct effect on safety behavior, but did have indirect effects. Job stress had both a direct and indirect effect. Safety culture had no direct effect, but did have an indirect effect. Also, safety climate had a significant direct effect. These findings can be used as preliminary data to develop additional safety programs for temporary construction workers. },

The research presented in this paper suggests a method for defining the critical information and the relevant information quality elements that is required to build the \{SSA\} in disaster response.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract There is growing interest in advancing knowledge and practice on the use of leading indicators to measure occupational health and safety (OHS) performance in organizations. In response we present psychometric analysis of the Organizational Performance Metric – Monash University (OPM-MU), which is a recently developed measure of leading indicators of \{OHS\} with several adaptations made as part of our investigation. Based on a national survey conducted with 3605 employees in 66 workplaces from several major organizations in Australia, we applied classical test (exploratory factor analysis) and item response (Rasch model analysis) theories to conduct a psychometric evaluation of the OPM-MU. Results revealed that the OPM-MU displayed good psychometric properties and evidence for both construct and criterion validity at employee and workplace levels. The OPM-MU could be used as an initial ‘flag’ of the leading indicators of \{OHS\} and has the potential to be a benchmarking tool for workplaces both within and across organizations. This paper represents an important advancement in the field of leading indicators of \{OHS\} performance and demonstrates that the OPM-MU is a promising new tool with demonstrated reliability and validity. },

A questionnaire survey of 1127 passengers in a train station in Melbourne, Australia, shows that respondents are not homogeneous in their perceptions and understanding of evacuation information, tools and procedure. Although the majority of respondents are familiar with the Melbourne train station and are of the opinion that it is easy to navigate the train station, they are not aware of the emergency evacuation way finding tools and procedure. More specifically, a significant proportion of the respondents do not know the emergency exit location (43.2%), evacuation plans/maps location (58.7%), the content of the evacuation plans/maps (56.8%), emergency red button location (41.6%), location of the assembly area (66.5%), and a quick way to the assembly area (66.3%). In terms of demographic differences, results from the ordered logit and generalised ordered logit models demonstrate that there are some differences in the understanding of way finding tools between males and females as well as among the different age groups. Our findings can assist managers of emergency response in developing appropriate strategies, design solutions, trainings, and education campaigns for effective and safe evacuation. Moreover, the results are a valuable resource in developing and verifying mathematical and theoretical models aiming to study passengers’ evacuation in a train station.},

It is also possible to use quantitative methods, based in different technics and metrics, as indicative exposure limits are been settled by several institutions. While performing the risk assessment, the information on the materials used is very important and, if it is not updated, it could create a bias in the assessment results.

It constitutes protection against placing objects and materials that could be used to perform an act of unlawful interference on board of an aircraft. The aim of this work was to create a model for assessment of airport baggage security control efficiency understood as the capability of detecting items prohibited in transport. Especially the human factor and the technical factor had to be taken into account collectively in the assessment of efficiency. Including many subjective factors such as operator’s assessment, tendency to make mistakes and the control process organisation method required using means adequate to the present informational uncertainty. In this case a hierarchical fuzzy inference system was used and it was implemented as the \{RBES\} computer system. Its important element is the completely new method of assessing the actual detectability of the prohibited items. The method is based on the analysis of the frequency of mistakes (called type A mistakes) consisting in not indicating a baggage, in which the screened image showed a prohibited item, as dangerous. The equally important element is including a few possible control process organisation options, so far not mentioned in the literature, in the analysis. The experiments on the model allowed to assess the baggage security control efficiency in real conditions and indicate the right control process organisation option. },

The context for the study is the use of functional internal control regulations for information and communication technology (ICT) safety and security in network companies within the Norwegian electric power supply sector. The rapid development in \{ICT\} has made traditional methods of command and control (prescriptive) regulation by government less adequate in coping with modern risks, and the introduction of internal control has been an attempt to develop new approaches and means to cope with new challenges of misfits between technology and regulation (Hovden, 1998). The article concludes that the degree of complexity, uncertainty and uncontrollability of a specific risk problem experienced by different actors, can explain varying attitudes toward the use of functional regulations for controlling risks. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract It has become increasingly common for rural fire-fighting agencies to encourage their volunteers to control and monitor their own levels of fatigue and performance abilities. Yet, the accuracy of subjective evaluations, especially during exposure to multi-stressor working conditions similar to those faced by rural fire-fighters has yet to be examined. A total of 91 rural fire-fighters took part in a 4-day/3-night live-in study that simulated a fire-ground tour. Fire-fighters were required to perform a total of 14 circuits that involved intermittent intense physical work, whilst exposed to heat, sleep deprivation, or a combination of both. Cognitive performance was measured using the Psychomotor Vigilance Task, with a self-reported measure of performance obtained before each cognitive battery. Overall, participants were able to predict their cognitive performance, however, there was a variety of factors involved in accuracy, including individual differences, and contributory factors fatigue such as environmental stressors, the length of shift, and the number of days worked. Subjective judgments appear to offer an effective, efficient, and cost effective tool in providing feedback in regard to in continuing work. In order for these to be effective however, subjective assessments should not be used in isolation, and fire-fighters must be trained, informed and given the tools to be able to recognise and monitor their own fatigue. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractBackground The impact of leadership on safety climate and safety outcomes has become an important area of research in organizational, leadership and safety sciences. There is evidence that safety-specific transformational leadership positively impacts safety outcomes including safety climate and safety behaviors. However, these relationships have not been thoroughly explored within the fire service. This study is one of the first known studies to examine the relationships between safety-specific transformational and passive leadership, safety climate and safety behavior outcomes in a sample of firefighters. Methods Data were collected from 398 professional firefighters in the southeastern United States. Structural equation modeling was used to complete the analyses and to examine hypothesized relationships. Results Safety-specific transformational leadership had a positive influence on safety climate perceptions among firefighters. Conversely, passive leadership, in the context of safety, had a negative impact on safety climate. As expected, safety climate perceptions are positively and significantly associated with safety behaviors, including safety compliance behaviors and safety participation behaviors. Conclusions These findings provide important evidence of the relationships between leadership styles, safety climate and safety behaviors in the fire service. Ultimately these findings provide guidance for public administrators, fire service administrators and company officers to bolster firefighter safety outcomes. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This research proposes a proactive modelling approach that combines Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping (FCM) and Human Factors Analysis and Classification System (HFACS). Principally, the suggested model helps predicting and eliminating the root causes behind the frequently repeating deficiencies on board ships. Supported with qualitative simulations, the HFACS–FCM model is demonstrated on a fire related deficiency sample database. The findings indicate that the root causes of a fire related deficiency on board ship might be revealed in various levels such as unsafe acts, pre-conditions for unsafe acts, unsafe supervision, and organization influences. Considering the determined root causes and their priorities, the Safe Ship System Mechanism (SSSM), Safe Ship Operation Mechanism (SSOM), and Safe Ship Execution Mechanism (SSEM) are constituted. Consequently, the paper has added value to both predicting the root causes and enhancing fire-fighting potential which provides reasonable contributions to safety improvements at sea. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The current study sought to address two gaps within the safety literature by (1) examining the dyadic context of safety motivation and safety behavior and (2) focusing on a psychological outcome of safety behavior – life satisfaction. Crossover theory was used as a framework to examine direct and mediated relationships among a sample of 217 married farm couples. Specifically, husbands’ and wives’ safety motivation were tested as predictors of husband safety behavior. Furthermore, husband safety behavior and wives’ perception of husbands’ safety behavior were examined as predictors of life satisfaction. Results indicated that wives’ safety motivation contributed to husbands’ safety behavior indirectly via husbands’ own safety motivation. Additionally, husband safety behavior significantly predicted personal life satisfaction and also contributed to spousal life satisfaction indirectly via wives’ perceptions. Overall, findings suggest the importance of considering both partners’ attitudes when examining antecedents and outcomes related to safety behavior among closely related individuals. Implications of these findings, as well as directions for future research are discussed. },

The enactment of dominant norms of masculinity in high risk occupations can be particularly problematic, as it exposes men to significant risks for injuries and fatalities. To encourage multi-disciplinary collaborations and advance knowledge in the intersecting areas of gender studies, men’s health, work and workplace health and safety, a national network of thirteen researchers and health and safety stakeholders completed a critical literature review examining the intersection between masculinities and men’s workplace health and safety in order to: (i) account for research previously undertaken in this area; (ii) identify themes that may inform our understanding of masculinity and workplace health and safety and; (iii) identify research and practice gaps in relation to men’s workplace health and safety. In this paper we present key themes from this review. Recommendations are made regarding: (i) how to define gender; (ii) how to attend to and identify how masculinities may influence workers’ identities, perceptions of occupational risks and how institutionalized practices can reinforce norms of masculinity; (iii) the importance of considering how masculinities may intersect with other variables (e.g. historical context, age, class, race, geographical location) and; (iv) the added significance of present-day labour market forces on men’s occupational health and safety. },

While regulation has been established, the beach as a roadway environment is complex and is a unique challenge for drivers. This paper describes the results of applying two systems analysis approaches, Accimap and Cognitive Work Analysis (CWA), to explore beach driving. Accimap is used to describe the actors within the system and the contributory factors involved in two recent fatal incidents. \{CWA\} is then used to describe the beach driving system within which these accidents are occurring, including the range of constraints impacting behaviour. The findings show that beaches present as complex multifaceted driving environments with a variety of competing and conflicting priorities. Further, the systems lens adopted enabled exploration of a range of contributory factors and revealed alternate likely pathways of accident causation and dependence within the management and regulation of beaches as roads. In closing we articulate a research agenda designed to enhance our understanding of the cultural, economic, and social implications of beach and off-road driving to improve safety and stakeholder coordination. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Considerable attention has been paid to safety culture since the 1986 Chernobyl nuclear power station accident. Researchers have studied it and companies and regulators have applied it to enhance safety. However, few research studies have been conducted that establish a link between safety culture and operational or process safety and methods used to assess safety culture, primarily questionnaires, have been criticized on methodological grounds. One way to enhance system safety is through applying the lessons of investigations of accidents of process safety to remediate organizational shortcomings identified in the investigation. Rather than attempting to assess safety culture directly, examining company actions and decisions directly after an accident can allow investigators to make inferences about safety culture at the time of the accident. This study suggests a method to directly examine the role of organizations in accidents by identifying the nature of organizational errors and describing the logic that can link these errors to accident causation. The application of this method in several accident investigations is described. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The objective of this paper is to show how qualitative resilience analysis approaches can be effectively structured for large sets of disturbances and strategies for work-as-done at the sharp end of a complex sociotechnical system. This is pursued by studying the roles of air traffic controllers and airline pilots in dealing with a wide set of disturbances in current air traffic operations. Disturbances are events or conditions that may affect one or more components or processes of the \{ATM\} system and thereby perturb air traffic operations. A set of 459 disturbances are clustered at three abstraction levels and characterised with respect to frequency of occurrence. Strategies of pilots and controllers for dealing with these disturbances are identified, and these strategies are also clustered at three hierarchical levels. The strategies are analysed with respect to key characteristics, such as detection and interpretation of the disturbances, coordination about the strategy, and strategy acquirement. The effects of the strategies on the key performance areas (KPAs) safety, capacity, environment and cost-efficiency are characterised and ranked. The results show that the strategies for dealing with disturbances have positive safety implications for the majority of disturbances and negligible safety effects for the remaining cases. The effects on the other \{KPAs\} are negligible in the majority of cases, but they are negative for a variety of disturbances. The results emphasize the important roles of pilots and controllers for dealing resiliently with disturbances in ATM. },

This situation calls for continued efforts to reduce these kinds of accidents as much as possible. To that effect, this study analyses the evolution and characteristics of 931 accidents that have occurred over the last decade (2003–2012) to teachers, researchers and administrative personnel in public universities in Andalusia. The variables have been grouped into four categories: temporal, personal, the circumstances of the accident, and its consequences. The results show that dependencies between the variables considered do exist and help shed light on aspects of the accidents such as: when they occurred, who the victim was, how they happened and what the consequences were. From these results, occupational safety technicians and others responsible for the assessment, prevention and protection of workers can focus their strategies on developing and providing specific and appropriate training to deal with hazards such as overexertion or falls, which account for more than half the accidents that occur to employees in the higher education sector in Andalusia. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Healthcare organisations are often encouraged to learn from other industries in order to develop proactive and rigorous safety management practices. In the \{UK\} safety–critical industries safety cases have been used to provide justification that systems are acceptably safe. There has been growing interest in healthcare in the application of safety cases for medical devices and health information technology. However, the introduction of safety cases into general safety management and regulatory practices in healthcare is largely unexplored and unsupported. Should healthcare as an industry be encouraged to adopt safety cases more widely? This paper reviews safety case practices in six \{UK\} industries and identifies drivers and developments in the adoption of safety cases. The paper argues that safety cases might best be used in healthcare to provide an exposition of risk rather than as a regulatory tool to demonstrate acceptable levels of safety. Safety cases might support healthcare organisations in establishing proactive safety management practices. However, there has been criticism that safety cases practices have, at times, contributed to poor safety management and standards by prompting a “tick-box” and compliance-driven approach. These criticisms represent challenges for the adoption of safety cases in healthcare, where the level of maturity of safety management systems is arguably still lower than in traditional safety–critical industries. Healthcare stakeholders require access to education and guidance that takes into account the specifics of healthcare as an industry. Further research is required to provide evidence about the effectiveness of safety cases and the costs involved with the approach. },

  Abstract                 = {AbstractObjective What influence has research conducted by general management schools and safety research had upon the causes of accidents and disasters in relation to the managing of safety between 1970 and 1979? Method The study was confined to original articles and documents, written in English or Dutch from the period under consideration. For the Netherlands, the professional journal De Veiligheid (Safety) was consulted. Results and conclusions Dominant management approaches started with (1) classical management starting from the 19th century incorporating as a main component scientific management from the early 20th century. The interwar period saw the rise of (2) behavioural management which was based on behaviourism, this was followed by (3) quantitative management from the Second World War onwards. After the war it was (4) modern management that became important. A company was seen as an open system, interacting with an external environment with external stakeholders. These management schools of thought were not exclusive, but existed side by side in the period under consideration. Early in the 20th century, it was the U.S. ‘Safety First’ movement that marked the starting point of this knowledge development in the sphere of safety managing, with cost reduction and production efficiency as the key drivers. Psychological models and metaphors were used to explain accidents resulting from ‘unsafe acts’. Safety was managed by training and targeting reckless workers, all in line with scientific management. Supported by behavioural management, this approach remained dominant for many years until long after World War II. Influenced by quantitative management, potential and actual disasters occurring after the war led to two approaches; loss prevention (up-scaling in the process industry) and reliability engineering (inherently dangerous processes in the aerospace and nuclear sectors). The distinction between process safety and occupational safety became clear after the war when the two evolved as relatively independent domains. In occupational safety in the 1970s human error was thought to be symptomatic of mismanagement. The term ‘safety management’ was introduced to scientific safety literature alongside concepts such as loosely and tightly coupled processes, organizational culture, disaster incubation and the notion of mechanisms blinding organizations to portents of disaster scenarios. Loss prevention remained technically oriented. Until 1979 there was no clear link with safety management. Reliability engineering that was based on systems theory did have such a connection with the \{MORT\} technique that served as a management audit. The Netherlands mainly followed Anglo-Saxon developments. In the late 1970s, following international safety symposia in The Hague and Delft, independent research finally began in the Netherlands. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The interest in multimodal transportation improvements in urban areas is increasing in cities across the U.S. Improved access to multimodal transportation attracts new users, but can possibly increase their exposure to risk from crashes, particularly in areas where the “safety in numbers” phenomenon does not exist. The relationship between access to multimodal transportation and safety in urban environment is complex, as non-motorized user vulnerability becomes a predominant risk factor when they are involved in a crash, even at lower vehicle speeds. This paper aims to evaluate the relationship between multimodal transportation infrastructure, expressed through the presence of multimodal facilities and user exposure, and traffic safety outcomes. Using Chicago as a case study, a comprehensive dataset is developed that significantly contributes to the existing literature by including socio-economic, land use, road network, travel demand, and crash data. Area-wide analysis on the census tract level provides a broader perspective about safety issues that multimodal users encounter in cities. Negative-binomial regression models with fixed and random effects are estimated to account for data overdispersion and spatial effects. Total vehicle-only crashes, total crashes with non-motorized users, and fatal vehicle-only crashes are modeled. The results show strong association between the variables related to multimodal transportation availability and usage, and both motorized and non-motorized crashes. Although simplified in terms of some spatial correlation assumptions, demonstrated methods prove to be a beneficial and computationally efficient tool for estimating and easily interpreting modeled relationships. Further research efforts to address the limitations of the presented approach are proposed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Construction is an inherently dangerous industry. Its injury rates for the industry annually rank near the top of all U.S. industries. The Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is charged with regulating U.S. workplace safety. Towards this end, they provide enforcement and promote training. A standardized 10 h training course sanctioned by \{OSHA\} is available for construction workers in all states. In 2004, Massachusetts became the first of seven states to legislate mandated \{OSHA\} 10 h training for construction workers on most public projects. Previous studies have shown that occupational safety training has beneficial effects on knowledge gain and improved behavior but there is weak evidence for improved safety outcomes. The natural experiment created by mandated training provided the opportunity to study the effects of mandated training on these outcomes. This study uses the Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS) 2004–2012 State Occupational Injury and Illness data in a random effects multiple regression analysis and \{BLS\} 2008–2011 fatality data from the Census of Fatal Occupational Injuries to examine fatality trends across different strata. The results are highly encouraging but fall short of definitive evidence. The post-mandate fatality trend results compare favorably against other state groupings and the non-fatal injury regression indicated a nearly statistically significant marginal effect for mandated training. However these results are clouded by the short duration of trend data and injury data known to be underreported. Recommendations include more extensive recordkeeping for \{OSHA\} 10 h training and improved injury surveillance. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This study explores managers’ perceptions of internal service quality (ISQ) for building a safety culture in Indonesian low-cost carriers (LCC), using the critical incident technique (CIT) approach to determine the domain constructs of ISQ. This study used departmental managers or district managers who were drawn at random from the directory of the Indonesian Directorate General of Civil Aviation (IDGCA), and the researchers conducted critical-incident interviews with 23 of them. These respondents described a total of 163 useable incidents, giving accounts of positive and negative internal evaluations of service quality drawn from these incidents. Based on retrospective interviews and, after the incidents had been categorized, the study found that domain constructs of \{ISQ\} included human factors, process, punctuality, sales and marketing and safety. The managers’ first-hand experiences helped clarify the domain constructs of \{ISQ\} in the \{LCC\} setting. By using internal service evaluations, management can assess the quality of service periodically and of safety awareness. These efforts could not only improve the reliability and quality of a company’s services but also allow management to diagnose service errors through important components of service quality specifically defined for the airline business. The results of this study could be used to help improve current service quality internally. The \{ISQ\} results suggest practical actions for improvements that provide guidance to management, which can be achieved by the using the internal service evaluation technique to increase passengers’ confidence in local air operators. These actions include improvements in human factors, process, punctuality, sales and marketing, and safety. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The safety climate in an organization is determined by how managers balance the relative importance of safety and productivity. This gives leaders a central role in safety in an organization, and from this follows that leadership training may improve safety. Transformational leadership may be one important component but may need to be combined with positive control leadership behaviors. Leadership training that combines transformational leadership and applied behavior analysis may be a way to achieve this. Purpose The study evaluates changes in safety climate and productivity among employees whose leaders (n = 76) took part in a leadership training program combining transformational leadership and applied behavior analysis. Changes in managers’ ratings of transformational leadership, contingent rewards, Management-by-Exceptions Active (MBEA) and safety self-efficacy were evaluated. Moreover, we compare whether the training has differentiated effects on safety depending on managers’ specific focus on improvements in: (1) safety, (2) productivity or (3) general leadership. Result Safety climate improved over time, while self-rated productivity remained unchanged. As hypothesized, transformational leadership, contingent rewards and safety self-efficacy as proxies for positive control behaviors increased while MBEA, a negative control behavior, decreased. Managers focusing on general leadership skills showed greater improvement in safety climate expectations. Conclusions Training leaders in both transformational leadership and applied behavior analysis is related to improvements in leadership and safety. There is no added benefit of focusing specifically on safety or productivity. },

The \{RFV\} enable the analysis to be conducted by means of model checking (MC), and consequently facilitate exhaustive search, based on the \{FRAM\} modeling, for potential performance of the system functional model. How hazards result from highly complex interactions among system functions, and how the scenario(s) where safety constraints are violated, is illustrated. In a case study, the method \{FRAMA\} was applied to a typical ferry capsizal accident, and the model checking results illuminate more details about the accident causes than both the details provided in the officially-issued investigation report and those produced by the current FRAM. },

A total of 47 enterprises was visited and asked to participate in a formal structured questionnaire. The findings show that the usage of personal protective equipment (PPE) was low, that lighting was often inadequate, and that these enterprises typically lacked routine organising and cleaning practices. The subsectors and the occupational health and safety practices were found to be independent, and a statistically significant relationship could only be established between the subsectors in terms of the use of dust masks and goggles. Despite the unfavourable working conditions, only one business out of 47 reported having an employee with symptoms of occupational diseases. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Structural engineers design buildings according to the earthquake action (demand) specified in code of practice, whilst the rationale behind such requirement is commonly untold. In fact, even if a structure is designed strictly in accordance to the best standard and practice in the world, there is still a (small) chance of failure or collapse in an extreme earthquake event, due to the uncertainties in material properties and actual ground motions characteristics. This is the residual risk, which is unavoidable, and should be taken as a governing parameter for determining the performance goals of seismic design. This study attempts to establish the required (target) collapse risk limits for designing different types of ordinary buildings based on a well-accepted tolerable level of mortality risk and estimates of fatality rates in buildings. The proposed limits are compared with the target risk of collapse stipulated in the 2012 edition of the International Building Code (IBC). The risk-based approach presented in this paper should also be applicable for setting performance objectives for structural design of buildings and infrastructure against other natural, human-caused and technological hazards. },

The work aims at the development of a calculating model that will use soft computing techniques to assess the occupational risk in the working place of shipyards using occupational accidents data. For each accident the following parameters have been considered as the model‘s input features: day and time, individual’s specialty, type of incident, dangerous situation and dangerous actions involved. Reported accident data were used as the training data for the \{MVLR\} model to map the relationship between the working conditions and occupational risk. With the fitness function based on this model, genetic algorithms were used for the prediction of occupational risk taking into consideration the severity and the frequency of occupational accidents data accumulated by ship repair yards. The working parameters’ values for minimum occupational risk were obtained using GAs. By comparing the predicted values with the reported data, it was demonstrated that the proposed model is a useful and efficient method for predicting the risk of occupational injury. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Exposure assessment is a strategy for anticipating, recognizing and evaluating employee exposures to physical, chemical, biological and ergonomic stresses at the workplace, so that effective and “sensible” controls can be put in place to mitigate the risk of occupational injury or occupational illness to the worker. It has been unveiled by this paper that this process is not applied adequately in Ghana and hence, hazards are not properly identified at workplaces. This leads to misapplication of controls or application of inadequate controls which tend not to reduce the risks at workplace. This outlines the various applicable exposure assessment strategies and also recommend controls and conditions that will make the process work in Ghana. It was outlined also that the process starts with the basic characterization which included area characterization, agent characterization and workforce characterization. This helps the industrial safety professional to understand the Similar Exposure Groupings (SEG’s) and their corresponding exposure profiles. This makes use of the basic statistics of the sample sizes of the SEG’s which get projected to the populations with 95% confidence interval so as to finalize tolerable risks. The modern engineer, the medic, and all relevant professionals must be conversant with this process and hence apply it at the workplace to ensure prevention of adverse exposures to employees, as well as prevention of accidents at the workplace. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Since the 1990s, the idea that accidents should be reduced to zero is gaining growing acclaim in the fields of road safety and occupational safety and health. As most of the literature on this so-called Zero Accident Vision (ZAV) deals exclusively with its application to road safety, which is a public sector responsibility, there is a need to learn more about the way it is implemented by private companies. This paper reports on a case study into the zero accident approach followed by steel company Tata Steel \{IJmuiden\} (the Netherlands). The study suggests that private sector advocates of the ZAV, unlike their public sector counterparts, tend to view safety aspirations and economic considerations as mutually reinforcing. However, it is shown that this harmony model does not entirely hold in practice. The findings also highlight another discrepancy. Characteristic of the \{ZAV\} is a systems-theoretic focus on identifying root causes of unsafe situations rather than on individual error and blame. Yet employee behavior appears to be a major target for Tata’s safety policy and several managers insist on punishing unsafe behavior. Paradoxically, this punitive tendency seems partly stimulated by and at the same time could hinder the very ambition of eradicating all accidents. },

This study provides an insight into this issue by obtaining a practitioner evaluation of \{STAMP\} and understanding how the method’s usage characteristics affect its use in a live investigation scenario. Six participants took part in a workshop to analyse data collected during a (high-fidelity, partly field-based) simulated investigation exercise using STAMP. The analysis outputs were assessed, along with the participants’ questionnaire and focus group responses pertaining to their experiences of using the method. When combining the mixed methods data generated during the study, a number of observations regarding the participants’ experiences of using \{STAMP\} were made. However, improving the method’s usability and graphical output were highlighted as key developments that may improve its acceptance by practitioners. },

Data for the study was collected during five months of fieldwork at the refinery and interviews with 70 refinery employees. In this paper, we examine how managers, engineers and operators at the refinery participated in activities aimed at learning from incidents. Incident learning did not just happen through formal incident management processes, but also through daily work practices. Hence, workplace learning may be an interesting lens through which to examine employee practices to learn from incidents. We found that employees executed learning-related tasks in different ways from formal presentation of reports and risk reducing measures to informal meetings and discussion raising the reflexivity of employees. We conclude this paper with recommendations for learning practices in large-scale industrial environments. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Cruise ships arriving in ports carry approximately 1000–3000 passengers and crewmembers. Such a concentration of people presents a high degree of risk in the event of a major disaster. To avoid the possibility of hazard events, the safety assessment is a mandatory document for every cruise ship. One of the methodologies for the systematic assessment of risk is a Formal Safety Assessment, a tool to determine and evaluate the risk of potential hazards. Deviations from predicted events could occur underway as well as at a port. Passenger terminals located in close proximity to other cargo terminals are additionally influenced by risks that are not manageable by the cruise ship safety management system. Possible accidents on cargo terminals, oil spills or fires could influence the safety of other ships and environment. A general approach is presented and discussed with particular focus on the specifics of the particular port, where the passenger terminal is close to other cargo terminals. The paper discusses the diverse aspects of safety analysis and methods for evaluation of individual and social risk. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The use of self-reported driver mileage, violations and crashes is very popular in traffic safety research, but their validity has been questioned. One way of testing validity is with an analysis of test–retest reliability. Three mechanisms might influence reliability in self report; actual changes in the variable over time, stable systematic reporting bias, and random error. Four samples of drivers who had responded twice to an online questionnaire asking them to report their mileage, violations and crashes were used and correlations between self reports for this data were calculated. The results for crashes were compared to expected correlations, calculated from the error introduced by the non-overlapping periods and the variable means. Reliability was fairly low, and controlling for mileage in the violations and crashes calculations did not strengthen the associations. The correlation between self reports of crashes in different time periods was found to be much larger than expected in one case, indicating a report bias, while the other correlation agreed with the predicted value. The correlations for overlapping time periods were much smaller than expected. These results indicate that drivers’ self reports about their mileage, violations and crashes are very unreliable, but also that several different mechanisms are operating. It is uncertain exactly under what circumstances different types of self report bias is operating. Traffic safety researchers should treat the use of self-reported mileage, violations and crashes with extreme caution and preferably investigate these variables with the use of objective data. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The Conflict Propensity Metric (CPM) and the Aggregate Conflict Propensity Metric (ACPM) are two simulation-based conflict metrics recently proposed as surrogate safety measures. The two metrics are derived through a stochastic process incorporating distributions of driver reaction time (RT) and vehicle maximum braking rates (MABR). This paper presents sensitivity analyses on the two metrics, by altering the parameters (i.e. mean and standard deviation) of \{RT\} distributions. Both \{RT\} mean and standard deviation affect the estimates of \{CPM\} for the three conflict types examined here (i.e. crossing, rear-end and lane change), and the impacts vary by conflict types, indicating the need of carefully evaluating and considering both \{RT\} distributions and conflict types when developing simulation-based conflict metrics. A sensitivity analysis based on field data showed that different \{RT\} distributions have an impact on \{ACPM\} and could affect the reliability of \{ACPM\} in identifying relative safety and its correlation with actual crashes. The analysis here identified the potential existence of different “realistic” \{RT\} distributions for different conflict types and the suggested values are considered reasonable or consistent with prior findings. \{ACPM\} has proved to have potential to further improve its accuracy using more suitable \{RT\} distributions. However, dedicated \{RT\} distributions for specific conflict types are lacking, especially a joint \{RT\} distribution conditional various factors, impeding the improvement of ACPM. In general, sensitivity analyses have shown the strength of the process of deriving \{CPM\} and \{ACPM\} by providing reasonable findings, as well as pointing out interesting and important future research directions, such as finding actual \{RT\} distributions for different conflict types. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Accidents remain a pervasive problem in tunnel construction. A major contributor to these accidents is a construction contractor’s inability to determine an appropriate trade-off between production and protection goals. Thus, to examine this issue, a systemic model, which integrates System Dynamics (SD), Bayesian Belief Networks (BBN) and smooth Relevance Vector Machines (sRVM) (referred to as ‘Organizational Risk Dynamics Observer’ (ORDO)), is developed to investigate the mechanism of risk migration that resulted from the interactions between a contractor’s organizational and technical systems. The model is demonstrated on an urban metro tunnel project that was constructed in Wuhan, China. It is revealed that when attention focused upon production, the propensity for minor accidents to occur increased, which triggered management to focus on protection. This increasing emphasis on protection may have muted the safe systems of working as incidents may be unreported, which can inhibit the motivation for safety awareness. When coupled with an increase in production pressure, the tunneling project could become prone to experiencing a major accident. Based on the results, it is suggested that the whole organization must continue to foster a sound safety culture by resisting production pressure at the expense of compromising safety. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Since 1980, there have been over 100 train collision accidents, resulting in many serious injuries and deaths as well as financial losses. In 2013 alone, there were cases of this type of accident in Switzerland, Argentina, America, Portugal and Russia. There are various causes of train collisions, including overrunning signals at danger, setting the wrong train routes, over-speeding, brake failures, etc. Setting the wrong train routes is regarded as the main cause of collisions. This paper proposes an approach to eliminate train route setting errors by applying parallel monitoring, which can be used to supervise train route setting and operator operation processes based on virtual image technique. Unlike a real interlocking system, this method can link together the traffic planning, operator operation, interlocking execution, train route occupation and releasing, to achieve the purpose of enhancing system safety and efficiency, whilst monitoring operator operations. The problems with existing train route setting systems are analyzed and a solution is proposed. The principle and methodology of using parallel monitoring to supervise train route setting based on virtual image technique are described. A designed architecture is illustrated and elaborated for a good understanding of the system. A case study of a Stochastic Petri Net (SPN) model using the proposed parallel monitoring is given, based on which the safety of the system is analyzed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Secondary traffic accidents are generally recorded without being specifically noted as such in the accident database, leading to difficulty in the study of such accidents. Previous research generally classified secondary incidents by predefining fixed spatio-temporal boundaries—a method that can be very subjective. Using 10,762 accident records gathered from 2012 upstream loop detector data on a California interstate freeway, this paper proposes a dynamic method for more convincing and accurate classification based on traffic shock waves detected by the loop detectors. This method identifies and associates a secondary accident with its primary accident if it is tested and found to have occurred within the spatio-temporal impact area of the primary accident. Shock waves from each accident are calculated and updated along freeway via multiple detectors, and secondary accidents are identified as those that occur within the spatio-temporal boundaries of a primary accident. Results show that secondary accidents account for 1.08% of California interstate freeway accidents, which is much lower than previous research estimates. Dispersed spatio-temporal gaps between primary and secondary accident pairs were found with an expectation of 71.09 min and 3.88 miles with a standard deviation of 55.36 min and 4.64 miles respectively. },

For risky driving, the subjective measures of sensation seeking, personal norm and intention to take risk were rated by after-experiment questionnaires. The measures of anonymity, ego-defensiveness, anger and subjective aggression were rated for aggressive driving. The perceived risk during interaction with bicycles was also rated. Cronbach’s alpha was used to calculate the internal consistency of each subjective measure. One-way \{ANOVA\} was used to compare the mean of each subjective measure and objective measure. Results showed that when having information and communication, sensation seeking, personal norm, intention, anonymity and perceived risk were significantly changed. Drivers had less risky and aggressive behavior and earlier behavior adjustment when interacting with bicycles. The results provide us with a better understanding of the effect of information sharing on risk-taking behavior in automobile driving. Information frequency and driver acceptance of the information system should be investigated in the future. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Thousands of mining accidents occur each year, especially in developing countries like China. To guarantee the safety and health of workers and reduce the probability of productivity decrease, this paper utilizes a nonlinear methodology to find the precedence of risk factors. Based on existing simulate experiments and relevant literatures, we draw a concept mapping of risk factors which involves managerial, environmental, operational and individual criteria. By using the fuzzy analytic hierarchy process (FAHP), we estimate and rank all of these factors to develop a management model and guide the safety managers in mining process. The logarithmic fuzzy preference programming (LFPP) method is applied to analyze the data. This method is new in risk assessment in coal mining process. The results are compared with that derived from the extent analysis (EA) method and with the help of the \{IBM\} \{SPSS\} Statistics the results are confirmed to be available in safety evaluation of coal mine. In addition, the proposed evaluation system is found out to be more convenient, precise and complete during the evaluation process, compared to traditional \{AHP\} and \{FAHP\} based on \{EA\} method. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Transportation professionals have long recognized the harm of trespassing along railway rights-of-way. However, the non-crossing rail trespassing issue has received less attention compared with highway–rail grade crossing crashes, despite the fact that nearly 8800 rail-trespassing crashes occurred on non-crossing rail tracks during the past decade with a large number of them resulting in fatality. Also, geographic and socio-demographic diversity within the \{US\} implies that trespassing crash severity and its correlates may vary across geographic entities or regions. The purpose of this paper is to investigate these issues using rail-trespasser crash data maintained by Federal Railroad Administration (N = 8794 over 2004–2013). The unique aspects of the study are the development of a framework that explores correlates of injury severity in crashes and applies appropriate analysis methods. Specifically, using rigorous spatial modeling methods (Geographically Weighted Regression), the study uncovers spatial variations in correlates between rail-trespassing injury and revealed contributing factors. The factors include personal attributes of individuals, environmental and location attributes, time of crash and pre-crash behaviors. The results show that non-crossing trespass crashes are generally severe with 52.1% involving a fatality. Pre-crash behaviors were found to be key factors showing significant associations with the probability of rail-trespassing injury, especially lying or sleeping (on or near tracks). Fundamentally, the basic assumption of spatial stationarity in traditional regression models does not fully hold in the situation explored. Correlates of injury severity are found to be non-stationary across space. Therefore, regional considerations in specific situations should guide the implementation of treatments and policies. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A number of common underlying factors in the development of human-created disasters, as cited in numerous official inquiry reports, encompass in particular, safety management system defects and weaknesses in an organization’s safety culture. Human factors such as faulty risk cognition, bounded rationality, groupthink, failure of foresight and organizational learning, suspect motivations, reactive attitudes, and inappropriate risk decision-making, are commonly associated characteristics of such shortcomings. This article summarizes and discusses underlying managerial and non-technical factors in human-created major hazard accidents in the light of theories of accident causation, findings from disaster inquiries and published research, and the systemic holism-versus-reductionism debate. Ideally, all site operators would know and understand disaster aetiology and preventive requirements and be motivated to enact them. However, there is sufficient empirical evidence from inquiry reports into major hazard incidents and disasters that idealized enactment rarely occurs and in many cases safety policy and strategy as enacted is distant from espoused safety policy and strategy. Research questions relating to board level thinking and actions on major hazard risks are posited and a proposal for a more holistic and potentially more effective major hazard safety research framework is put forward. },

The Middle East witnesses poor safety management where companies need to improve their performance instead of hiding their deficiencies. This study aims at evaluating safety performance and network resilience to risks by studying safety-related interactions among the construction team. Safety on three mega-projects is evaluated by analyzing their respective networks for communication and safety management and mapping them using Gephi. Using Social Network Analysis (SNA), visualizations and various metrics were computed revealing network characteristics and communication patterns. Resilience metrics were measured using actual safety performance data and overall network resilience was simulated through agent-based modeling using NetLogo. Results and correlations show that networks with better interaction and structure have higher resilience to prevalent risks and have better actual safety performance. },

Based on one-to-one interviews with 707 coal miners in Chinese state-owned coal mining enterprises and an exploratory factor analysis, we determined the dimensions of coal miner safety commitment. The different effects of demographic variables and organizational/work-related variables on coal miner safety commitment and its dimensions were investigated using a one-way ANOVA. Our study showed that coal miner safety commitment is a three-dimensional concept, which comprises safety attitude commitment, safety behavior commitment, and safety results commitment. Coal miner safety commitment and its dimensions differed significantly with respect to demographic and organizational/work-related variables. We found that coal miners with a low safety commitment level tended to be localized and they were distributed mainly in groups of underground front-line coal miners, young coal miners, and coal miners with middle and higher degrees, low underground work seniority, poor physical condition, and low income levels. This study provides practical guidance (e.g., recruitment, personnel promotion, employee assistance program) to help managers address the present situation and to improve the safety commitment of coal miners, as well as enhancing the organizational management policy. },

The results show that some socio-economic factors, such as the secondary industry added value, scalable industrial output value, infrastructure investment, and gross domestic product, and social factors, such as medical beds, fiscal expenditure, deposits from residents, and employed persons, had significant effects on the occupational safety situation in counties. An S-shaped relationship was also found between the increase of socio-economic development level and the death toll among clusters. Socio-economic inequalities could influence occupational safety on the county level and the significant growth in social level can improve occupational safety situation. },

Using 150 major industrial accidents and their disclosed investigation reports from the State Administrative of Work Safety of China (SAWSC), we found that the number of administrative penalty, judicial penalty, fines and the accident investigation duration by the government are significantly affected by the environmental pressures including the legal environment pressure, media attention pressure, enterprise ownership pressure and the industry pressure. According to the Deterrence Theory and the Social Learning Theory, the involvement and promptness of penalties significantly influence the deterrent effect for observing peers.

It outlines three functions of rules in organizations (as a means for organizational control, as coordination mechanism, and as codified organizational knowledge) and applies these to safety rules in high-risk industries. Four common challenges of safety rules, as well as four typical measures of good rules management are illustrated by discussing examples from safety research. These challenges and typical measures of rules management are furthermore examined in terms of the three functions of rules in organizations.

A qualitative research methodology using the theory of planned behavior as a framework was employed. A series of interviews and focus groups with licensed electrical workers (N = 46) were analyzed using thematic content analysis. Beliefs were classified as advantages (e.g. personal safety of self and co-workers), disadvantages (e.g., inconvenience to customer/clients and workload), referents (e.g., supervisors, work colleagues, customers), barriers (e.g., time and cost), and facilitators (e.g., training and knowledge, equipment availability) of safety adherence. The belief basis of the theory of planned behavior was a useful framework for exploring workers’ safety beliefs. The identified beliefs can inform future research about the important factors influencing safe work decisions and inform strategies to promote safer workplace decision making within the electrical safety context. },

The effect of these 2 types of interventions is tested on two road segments of regional roads (with a maximum speed of 70 and 90 km/h), whereby interventions were switched between both roads during the second field experiment. To measure the effect of both methods, the average speed, 85th percentile of speed and odds of drivers exceeding the speed limit were analyzed, mainly by using general linear regression models. Results show for each tested intervention, significant speed reductions during the time that enforcement was in place. Generalizing these results, allows us to conclude that the effect during the speed control with advanced warning sign is larger compared to the speed control only (respectively −4.5 km/h and −2.5 km/h in the \{V85\} speed) and also the continuing effect until one week after the intervention is higher. In the future, we recommend repeating the experiment on more locations, to enhance the reliability and generalizability of the results. To do so, further cooperation between knowledge institutions and field practitioners is advisable. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The work of \{HSE\} (Health, Safety, Environment) professionals in industrial companies is a complex mix of reactive tasks requiring a fast response and more analytical tasks needing analyses. Moreover, doing this job means being able to dialog with different stakeholders, including operators in the field, top managers in headquarters and authorities, and to drive in parallel many different tasks at strategic, tactical and operational levels. To face these challenges, companies are in the urgent need to hire competent people to manage health, safety and environment protection, cope with restrictive legal frameworks and preserve their image in the public that is increasingly more concerned about industrial risks. This opens opportunities for the new generations of postgraduate students: “An academic qualification is regarded essential since those specialists must be capable to address new problems by applying knowledge and skills to situations not previously encountered” Arezes and Swuste (2012) In this paper, we present an analysis of missions, tasks and experience of \{HSE\} professionals, from which we identified the present and future roles, missions and required skills of a safety officer. This analysis was then used to define a postgraduate program aiming at providing students with the required knowledge, know-how and attitudes needed to succeed as \{HSE\} professionals in industrial, consultancy and insurance companies. This program covers six complementary domains: legal and normative framework, risk analysis methods and tools, safety management systems, human and organizational aspects, leadership, emergency and crisis management. It is composed of lectures provided equally by faculty members and professionals, case studies and a set of field projects during which the group of students has to fulfill real missions provided by companies. The program also includes a 6-month internship in a company, during which the student is playing the role of junior \{HSE\} professional, under the supervision of a manager in the company and a member of the faculty. Nowadays, most companies operate at a global scale in different countries. \{HSE\} professionals, like other managers need to work in an international context, with colleagues from different backgrounds and cultures. To prepare our students to this challenging environment, we select candidates from different countries and backgrounds and we balance these differences in relatively small cohorts of 15–20 students. This intercultural group gives each student opportunities to work with different skills and cultures in teams varying from one project to the next. },

The overarching objective of the paper is to find out how to provide good risk information for such decisions. The discussion starts from description of what good risk information is, followed by a proposal to use Activity consequence risk (ACR) – the effect that performing an activity will have on the risk level after the activity has been completed; Activity performance risk (APR) – the risk associated with performing the action; and Period risk (PR) – risk for a plant or facility over a period of time, to structure a complete risk picture. A simplified example is given to show how the proposed criteria can assist in providing better risk information. Challenges to provide such information are thoroughly discussed. The main conclusion is that current practices in the industry lack the accuracy and capability to provide such a risk picture. },

The purpose of this paper is to clarify what we actually need to express when we use risk information to support various decision scenarios. We distinguish decision scenarios into strategic decisions, operational decisions, instantaneous decisions and emergency decisions. This forms a basis for discussing the different role risk and risk assessment plays in these decisions. Five categories of risk information (average risk, site-specific average risk, activity risk (activity performance risk and activity consequence risk), period risk and time-dependent action risk) are proposed and applications for different types of decisions are discussed. An example illustrates the use of the proposed risk types. The classification has novel aspects in providing a structure that should help in understanding how we need different aspects of risk and different ways of expressing risk in different situations. In addition, it improves communication among decision-makers by clarifying what aspects we are addressing when we use the term “risk”. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A rail transit network usually represents the core of a city’s public transportation system. The overall topological structures and functional features of a public transportation network, therefore, must be fully understood to assist the safety management of rail transit and planning for sustainable development. Based on the complex network theory, this study took the Beijing Subway system (BSS) as an example to assess the robustness of a subway network in face of random failures (RFs) as well as malicious attacks (MAs). Specifically, (1) the topological properties of the rail transit system were quantitatively analyzed by means of a mathematical statistical model; (2) a new weighted composite index was developed and proved to be valid for evaluation of node importance, which could be utilized to position hub stations in a subway network; (3) a simulation analysis was conducted to examine the variations in the network performance as well as the dynamic characteristics of system response in face of different disruptions. The results reveal that the \{BSS\} exhibits typical characteristics of a scale-free network, with relatively high survivability and robustness when faced with RFs, whereas error tolerance is relatively low when the hubs undergo MAs. In addition, illustrations of dynamic variations in the influence of the \{BSS\} under a series of \{MAs\} were provided by spatial analysis techniques of Geographical Information System (GIS), which directly verified the earlier conclusions. We believed the proposed methodology and the results obtained could contribute to a baseline for relevant research of transportation topological robustness. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The Bayesian Network (BBN) has been a popular method for risk assessment especially for the modeling of rare accidents. It could make use of experts’ domain knowledge when historical data were not enough to support the use of other statistical methods. In the maritime domain, the Bayesian Network has been widely used for risk prediction by modeling the causal relationship of shipping accidents where a lot of human and organizational factors are involved. Most of the models depend on experts’ elicitation for model construction and parameterization. The involvement of experts’ judgment brings uncertainty and biases. In contrast, data-driven \{BBN\} is considered more objective since it is learnt from empirical data. However, even though researchers started to explore the application of data-driven \{BBN\} in recent years, its application is still constrained due to the rare occurrence of maritime accidents and the incompatibility of accident databases. As a result, experts’ knowledge continues to be an important source for modeling. Reducing the elicitation workload and facilitating the elicitation of individual conditional probability are the two most important tasks for \{BBN\} modeling with experts’ knowledge. Different techniques that facilitate experts’ elicitation process were reviewed in this paper. Some of these methods have been applied in the maritime risk model while new techniques should be developed and applied as well to address the uncertainty and improve accuracy of modeling shipping accidents. },

Based on the simulation results, we find that with the decrease of the initial load of power node, the critical threshold of tolerance parameter increases subjected to the highest load node-based attack, but the critical threshold decreases subjected to the lowest load node-based attacks. Meanwhile, we discover that the critical threshold subjected to the lowest load node-based attack is larger than that subjected to the highest load node-based attack when the tunable parameter α ∈ [0.1, 0.9]. Moreover, this paper compares the new model with the other two existing models, and the results illustrate that there are many similarities between these two existing models, but they are different from the new model presented in this paper. Furthermore, the infimum of tolerance parameter is proposed to portray the minimum cost of power grid, which can give a method to construct more robust power grids in the future. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Large cities depend heavily on their metro systems to reduce traffic congestion, which is particularly the case with Shanghai, the largest and most developed city in China. For the purposes of enhancing the possibility in quantitative risk assessment and promoting the safety management level in Shanghai metro, an adaptable metro operation incident database (MOID) is therefore presented for containing details of all incidents that have occurred in metro operation. Taking compatibility and simplicity into consideration, Microsoft Access 2010 software is used for the comprehensive and thorough design of the MOID. Based on MOID, statistical characteristics of incident, such as types, causes, time, and severity, are discovered and 24 accident precursors are identified in Shanghai metro. The processes are demonstrated to show how the \{MOID\} can be used to identify trends in the incidents that have occurred and to anticipate and prevent future accidents. In order to promote the application of MOID, an organizational structure is proposed from the four aspects of supervision, research, implementation, and manufacturer. This research would be conducive to safety risk analysis in identifying relevant precursors in safety management and assessing safety level as a qualitative tool. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Safety management in construction is an integral effort and its success requires inputs from all stakeholders across design and construction phases. Effective risk mitigation relies on the concordance of all stakeholders’ risk perceptions. Many researchers have noticed the discordance of risk perceptions among critical stakeholders in safe construction work, however few have provided quantifiable evidence describing them. In an effort to fill this perception gap, this research performs an experiment that investigates stakeholder perceptions of risk in construction. Data analysis confirms the existence of such discordance, and indicates a trend in risk likelihood estimation. With risk perceptions from low to high, the stakeholders are architects, contractors/safety professionals, and engineers. Including prior studies, results also suggest that designers have improved their knowledge in building construction safety, but compared to builders they present more difficultly in reaching a consensus of perception. Findings of this research are intended to be used by risk management and decision makers to reassess stakeholders’ varying judgments when considering injury prevention and hazard assessment. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The construction industry has adopted control measures of electrical hazards for decades, however construction workers are still electrocuted in the workplace every year. This problem leads to a need for assessing the quality of control measures. The goal of this study is to assess the control measures of electrical hazards using a perspective of hierarchy of controls (HOC). \{HOC\} counts control measures of five levels in descending effectiveness, which are Elimination, Substitution, Engineering, Administration, and Personal protective equipment. This study uses mixed methods of narrative text analysis and statistical analysis in examining 486 \{NIOSH\} recommended controls from fatality investigations. Findings reveal that behavioral controls remain prevalent in electrical hazard mitigation even though the knowledge of construction safety and health has increased in the past decades. This study also finds that effectiveness of controls is not statistically different by construction type nor occupation. Proposing a solution, the authors suggest that construction managers strictly stick to \{HOC\} rules by giving priority to higher level of controls and highly recommend that the U.S. construction industry leverage its prevention strategy by embracing more technological innovations and incentivizing prevention through design. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Regional risk assessment for urban major hazards is significant for environment protection and public safety. In practice, repeating geoprocessing steps required in risk mapping process is quite timeconsuming, and it has been a challenge for both researchers and managers. In this study, we designed and implemented a tool for facilitating the process of urban regional risk assessment. Geoprocessing workflow models are built for severity calculation, vulnerability evaluation and risk mapping respectively. We then integrate these models into an automatic \{GIS\} tool, and apply it in a typical urban district of north China to demonstrate its functionalities and utility. The risk map successfully obtained shows that it has potential to be a useful decision support tool for guiding emergency management and urban planning. This work offers new insights and valuable demonstration on promoting future risk assessment with the use of emerging \{GIS\} geoprocessing technology in the Big Geo-Data age. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Failure Mode and Effects Analysis (FMEA) has been extensively used for examining potential failures in many industries. Unlike the traditional FMEA, the risk factors of occurrence (O), severity (S) and detection (D) of each failure mode are evaluated by linguistic terms and fuzzy ratings in this research, and their relative weights are considered, which make the results more useful and practical. Both grey theory and fuzzy theory are applied in FMEA, in which fuzzy set theory is used to calculate the fuzzy risk priority numbers (FRPNs), and grey theory is applied to calculate the grey relational coefficient. The rankings of the failure modes are both determined by \{FRPNs\} and the grey theory. An example of oil tanker equipment failure is provided, and the results show that the evaluation of failure modes by both fuzzy theory and grey theory are quite similar. The practical application of fuzzy and grey theories proposed in this paper helps to enhance the reliability of the prediction, and the predicted ranking of equipment failure can be used for better decision-making concerning inspection and maintenance, which in turn will make tanker shipping more safe and reliable. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Digitalization is a trend in large-scale complex systems such as nuclear power plants (NPPs). It changes the way main control room (MCR) operators interact with systems. Many studies shows that the adoption of digital technology has brought some new risks for \{MCR\} operators, and whether the reliability of these technologies can meet safety and economic requirements has become one of the urgent problems that \{NPPs\} must solve. The study consists of two parts. In Part I, we investigated the dynamic evolution of operators’ four behaviors: monitoring and detection (MD), situation assessment (SA), response planning (RP), and response implementation (RI). This paper incorporates Boolean network (BN) analysis into the field of human reliability analysis (HRA), by applying semi-tensor product of matrix (STP), whereby the dynamics evolution of operators’ behavior can be expressed in an algebraic form. Utilizing this algebraic representation, a \{BN\} analysis model is proposed, on which we based a qualitative analysis. An illustrative example is given to show how to construct the \{BN\} model via experimental data. We also discuss the advantage of the proposed methodology, its feasibility and highlighting the future work remaining. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract With the technical development of computer hardware and software, digitalization is a trend in large-scale complex systems such as nuclear power plants (NPPs). It changes the way main control room (MCR) operators interact with systems. Faced with these technical changes, operators need to continue improving their situation assessment (SA) reliability level. In addition to evaluate operators’ \{SA\} reliability, managers and shift supervisors also want to forecast their \{SA\} reliability level. There have been many studies with respect to operators’ SA, but most of them are static analysis method and cannot be applied to predict operators’ \{SA\} reliability. So, on the basis of different forecasting approaches and observation data, how to predict the operators’ \{SA\} reliability level has became a problem that many analyst interest in. In this paper, first we identified the influence factors associated with \{SA\} reliability, and then we developed the \{SA\} reliability model, finally we proposed a reliability forecasting model by integrating time series forecasting method with dynamic network model (DNM). Our experiment verification focused on steam generator tube rupture (SGTR) event, using the forecasting model, we demonstrated how to predict operators’ \{SA\} reliability during the course, and the prediction results are consistent with measurement results. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) sponsored a multiyear pilot demonstration of Clear Signal for Action (CSA), a safety culture intervention implemented with Behavioral Science Technology Inc., at a Union Pacific (UP) service unit. \{CSA\} combines peer-to-peer feedback, continuous improvement, and safety-leadership development. The \{US\} Department of Transportation John A. Volpe National Transportation Systems Center conducted an independent program evaluation of the pilot, using qualitative and quantitative measures. The evaluation found that, over two years, the site experienced significant improvements in safety outcomes, operations, and safety culture, including an 80% drop in at-risk behaviors, a 79% decrease in engineer decertification rates, a 81% decline in the rate derailments and other incidents, and better labor–management relations. Comparison locations showed no improvements in the decertifications or derailments. The success of the pilot, in addition to successes \{UP\} had earlier with CSA-type processes, encouraged \{UP\} to expand these processes throughout its transportation department. The success of this pilot and other similar pilots led to the development and adoption of the FRA’s Railroad Safety Risk Reduction Program in the Rail Safety Improvement Act of 2008, and the implementation of similar safety-culture programs by other carriers.},
