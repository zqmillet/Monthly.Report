  Abstract                 = {Abstract The emerging Liquid-Sensing Enterprise (LSE) concept provides manufacturing industrial networks with the required enablers to seamless interoperate and sustain its interoperability along the operational life cycle. Actually, the actual domain of enterprise information systems interoperability prospects the need for a new paradigm able to manage the network dynamics, facilitating adaptation along the lifecycle of an enterprise and the \{LSE\} network. The theory of complex systems provides a set of heuristics that can be applied to support the formalization of the \{LSE\} industrial network and its dynamics, demonstrating how they can be enabled and at the same time controlled to keep the overall level of interoperability stable. Hence, today there is technology suitable to implement such systems, capable to realize the \{LSE\} real, digital and virtual worlds. However, isolated, this technology cannot deliver the requirements for a self-sustainable \{LSE\} network. The authors propose a novel metaphor from complexity as a framework to model and implement the mechanism for sustaining interoperability in such networked environments. They identify the motivations for sustaining interoperability of networked liquid-sensing enterprises, having complex and adaptive systems as a vehicle to model and understand the relationships between enterprises and enterprise information systems in networked environments. Then, existing technology such as model-driven interoperability, agent-based or service oriented architectures, and knowledge management, is proposed to detail the conceptual solution for the sustainability of interoperability. An instantiation of the concept proposed is presented, which details the prototypal application elaborated in a real manufacturing scenario, implemented and validated during the European Project Factories of the Future IMAGINE. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Nowadays there are many good textbooks on classical control in the English language. The fact that many of them are similar in scope and content seems to suggest that the field has reached maturity. The first books on classical control were published shortly before the World War II. It is possible to detect a few early books that had a strong influence on how the field was to evolve, at least in what concerns textbooks. Several topics have been dropped throughout the years, many have converged to a “standard” form of presentation, and others were included on the way. The main aim of this paper was to describe the development in the content of classical control textbooks and to illustrate the great diversity of terms used in the early days of the field. Emphasis is placed on books published in the 1940s and 1950s. This historical point of view is especially relevant to those who teach control at various levels and will provide motivation for students. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper presents two acoustic-based techniques for Autonomous Underwater Vehicle (AUV) navigation within an underwater network of fixed sensors. The proposed algorithms exploit the positioning measurements provided by an Ultra-Short Base Line (USBL) transducer on-board the vehicle to aid the navigation task. In the considered framework the acoustic measurements are embedded in the communication network scheme, causing time-varying delays in ranging with the fixed nodes. The results presented are obtained with post-processing elaborations of the raw experimental data collected during the CommsNet13 campaign, organized and scientifically led by the \{NATO\} Science and Technology Organization Centre for Maritime Research and Experimentation (CMRE). The experiment involved several research institutions and included among its objectives the evaluation of on-board acoustic \{USBL\} systems for navigation and localization of AUVs. The \{ISME\} groups of the Universities of Florence and Pisa jointly participated to the experiment with one Typhoon class vehicle. This is a 300 m depth rated \{AUV\} with acoustic communication capabilities originally developed by the two groups for archaeological search in the framework of the \{THESAURUS\} project. The CommsNet13 Typhoon, equipped with an acoustic modem/USBL head, navigated within the fixed nodes acoustic network deployed by CMRE. This allows the comparison between inertial navigation, acoustic self-localization and ground truth represented by \{GPS\} signals (when the vehicle was at the surface). },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Wave energy converters (WECs) require active control to maximise energy capture over a wide range of sea conditions, which is generally achieved by making the device resonate. The exaggerated device motion arising at resonance, however, may result in nonlinear effects that are ignored by the linear models that are typically employed. In particular, nonlinear viscous forces are significant for particular device types, such as hinged flaps, which we take as a case study in this paper. The paper develops a general nonlinear \{WEC\} control methodology based on pseudospectral methods. The continuous time energy maximisation problem is fully discretised (both state and control), and the optimal solution is obtained by solving the resulting finite dimensional optimisation problem. By way of example, the nonlinear viscous damping for a hinged flap \{WEC\} is incorporated into the control model which also considers non-ideal power take-off efficiency. It is shown that the ratio of energy captured to energy dissipated is significantly increased with the nonlinear controller, compared to the linear case. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Among renewable energy sources, wind power is expected to contribute a larger and rapidly growing portion of the world's energy portfolio. However, the increased penetration of wind power into the power grid has challenged the reliable and stable operation of the grid. This motivates new opportunities in the design and development of novel control schemes capable of actively maintaining the necessary balance between power generation and load, which in turn regulates the grid frequency when plenty of winds are available. This paper presents two active power control schemes that are developed based on adaptive pole placement control and fuzzy gain-scheduled proportional-integral control approaches. The active power control is conducted collectively across a wind farm to provide rapid power response while maintaining safe structural loading on turbines’ components. The proposed active power control schemes are evaluated and compared by a series of simulations on an advanced wind farm benchmark model in the presence of wind turbulences, measurement noises, and grid load variations. It is further demonstrated that the mentioned schemes are able to tolerate probable occurrence of sudden imbalance between generation and load due to relevant faults/failures in the wind farm or electric grid. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper reviews state of the art in the area of decentralized networked control systems with an emphasis on event-triggered approach. The models or agents with the dynamics of linear continuous-time time-invariant state-space systems are considered. They serve for the framework for network phenomena within two basic structures. The I/O-oriented systems as well as the interaction-oriented systems with disjoint subsystems are distinguished. The focus is laid on the presentation of recent decentralized control design and co-design methods which offer effective tools to overcome specific difficulties caused mainly by network imperfections. Such side-effects include communication constraints, variable sampling, time-varying transmission delays, packet dropouts, and quantizations. Decentralized time-triggered methods are briefly discussed. The review is deals mainly with decentralized event-triggered methods. Particularly, the stabilizing controller–observer event-based controller design as well as the decentralized state controller co-design are presented within the I/O-oriented structures of large scale complex systems. The sampling instants depend in this case only on a local information offered by the local feedback loops. Minimum sampling time conditions are discussed. Special attention is focused on interaction-oriented system architecture. Model-based approach combined with event-based state feedback controller design is presented, where the event thresholds are fully decentralized. Finally, several selected open decentralized control problems are briefly offered as recent research challenges. },

The basic models of interconnected systems described as continuous-time linear time-invariant systems in the time domain serve as a framework for the inclusion of communication channels in the decentralized feedback loop. The I/O-oriented models and the interaction oriented models with disjoint subsystems and interactions are distinguished. The overview is focused on packet dropouts, transmission delays, and quantization effects which are included in the time-driven design of feedback loop components. Single- and multiple-packet transmissions are considered in this contents. The design of decentralized state feedback gain matrices with delayed feedback uses the methodology of sampled-data feedback design for continuous-time systems, while the decentralized H∞ quantizer design is based on the static output controller. The Liapunov stability approach results in computationally efficient decentralized control design strategies described by using linear matrix inequalities. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract New technologies are emerging to enable and support physical, implicit and explicit collaborations. They are essential for dealing with increasingly complex systems in unstructured, dynamic environments. The purpose of this article is to review the role of laser technology in enabling better, more precise interactions and their control, and to identify opportunities and challenges in this area. While the most common applications of laser technology are found in medical and health care, manufacturing, and communication, other domains such as safety, quality assurance, agriculture, construction, entertainment, defense, transportation, and law enforcement also benefit from it. In spite of the rapid dissemination of this technology, its role in support of collaboration and discovery is still in its infancy. Research activities concerning new ways of using lasers as a collaboration supporting technology that may strengthen new areas have been relatively limited. Nevertheless, the translation to this domain of collaboration support has been recognized as vital for activities that demand increasingly more coordinated effort among interacting agents (e.g., humans, machines, particles) and digital, possibly also photonic agents. Recent advances in laser technology in a number of application domains are reviewed in this article, focusing primarily on lasers’ role for supporting different forms of precision interactions and collaboration. In addition, a framework with five collaboration support functions and five collaboration dimensions is defined for this review. The taxonomy framework is useful for enabling better understanding of the existing and emerging opportunities that laser-based technology offers for collaboration support, its advantages and several research gaps. },

In order to improve the consistency of the whole system design and the related data and information, knowledge crossing the expertises must be tracked and formalized regarding a shared reference. That means that instead of defining a large reference models to which each expert refers to, a light collaborative model is defined enabling to connect data from each expert model to adhoc data from other expert models, following the least commitment principle. In this topic, a new meta-model is proposed in a Model-Driven Engineering approach to manage the integration of heterogeneous experts’ knowledge models in a collaborative process. The structure of the proposed knowledge meta-model is defined taking into account the complexity of knowledge definition and the properties of its components. This meta-model is split in a meta-model of data on one hand and a Collaboration Meta-Model in the other hand, to represent the distinction between the core concepts of knowledge and additional elements serving to represent the relation between these concepts, and between concepts of heterogeneous experts’ models. The proposed meta-model is illustrated on an industrial case study to highlight the way to put it in use, and its interests to enable collaboration between experts throughout the design process. },

  Abstract                 = {Pursuit of a closed-loop artificial pancreas that automatically controls the blood glucose of individuals with type 1 diabetes has intensified during the past 6 years. Here we discuss the recent progress and challenges in the major steps towards a closed-loop system. Continuous insulin infusion pumps have been widely available for over two decades, but “smart pump” technology has made the devices easier to use and more powerful. Continuous glucose monitoring (CGM) technology has improved and the devices are more widely available. A number of approaches are currently under study for fully closed-loop systems; most manipulate only insulin, while others manipulate insulin and glucagon. Algorithms include on–off (for prevention of overnight hypoglycemia), proportional–integral–derivative (PID), model predictive control (MPC) and fuzzy logic based learning control. Meals cause a major “disturbance” to blood glucose, and we discuss techniques that our group has developed to predict when a meal is likely to be consumed and its effect. We further examine both physiology and device-related challenges, including insulin infusion set failure and sensor signal attenuation. Finally, we discuss the next steps required to make a closed-loop artificial pancreas a commercial reality. },

Thus, this paper is about the use of systems thinking and systems theory in \{EA\} and about how it is possible to reconcile and understand, based on a single overarching framework, the interplay of two major enterprise change endeavours: on one hand enterprise engineering (i.e. deliberate change) and on the other hand evolutionary, organic change. The paper also demonstrates how such change processes can be illustrated by employing systems thinking to construct dynamic business models; the evolution of these concepts is exemplified using past applications in networked enterprise building, and more recent proposals in environmental-, disaster- and healthcare management. Finally, the paper attempts to plot the way GERAM, as a framework to think about the creation and evolution of complex socio-technical systems, will continue to contribute to the society in the context of future challenges and emerging opportunities. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The paper considers the problem of Automated Guided Vehicles (AGVs) fleet scheduling subject to the right match-up of local cyclic acting \{AGV\} schedules to given workpiece machining schedules. The main contribution of this work is the solution to a constraint satisfaction problem aimed at \{AGVs\} fleet match-up scheduling while taking into consideration assumed itineraries of concurrently manufactured product types. In other words, assuming a given layout of FMS’s material handling and production routes of simultaneously manufactured work orders as well as cyclic schedules of concurrently manufactured product types, the goal is to provide a declarative model enabling multimodal processes, i.e. employing AGVs, hoists, lifts, etc. demand-responsible scheduling of transportation/handling services. An algebra-like driven approach to cyclic scheduling based on step-by-step composition of multimodal transportation network sub-structures is proposed. Results of computational experiments assessing scalability of the method provided are presented as well. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Automation led to many innovations for a long time, most of them were developed during the twentieth century. It was commonly thought as a layer on top of a mechanical system. It promoted system management over low-level control. The more information technology evolves, the more it takes a fundamental part in our lives. This article describes a paradigm shift where automation will no longer be an add-on, and where software supports the definition, implementation and operationalization of functions and structures of products from the beginning of the design process. Any design today starts by using computer-aided design tools that enable us to easily draw, modify and fine-tune any kind of system. We can fully develop an airplane and literally fly it as a complex piece of software. Usability and usefulness can be tested before anything physical is built. Consequently, human-centered design (HCD) is now not only feasible but also can drive the overall engineering of products. We have started to design products from outside in, i.e., from usages and purposes to means. We even can 3D print mechanical parts from the software-designed parts with ease. In human–computer interaction, specific research efforts are carried out on tangible objects, which define this inverted view of automation. We now design and develop by using information technology to do mechanical things, and therefore redefine the essence of a new kind of cognitive mechanical engineering. This article is about the revolution that is currently happening in engineering and industrial design due to the immersive influence of computers in our everyday life, and the expansion of HCD. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Modern societies have reached a point where everyday life relies heavily on desired operation of critical infrastructures, in spite of accidental failures and/or deliberate attacks. The issue of desired performance operation of \{CIS\} at high security level receives considerable attention worldwide. The pioneering generic methodologies and methods are presented in the paper project for designing systems capable of achieving these objectives in the cost effective manner at existing \{CIS\} and also in the future. A control systems engineering approach to integrated monitoring, control and security of critical infrastructure systems (CIS) is applied. A multilayer structure for an intelligent autonomous reconfigurable agent operating within a single region of a \{CIS\} is derived first. Methods and algorithms for synthesising the layers are proposed so that the agent can autonomously perform required control activities under wide range of operating conditions. The required ability of the system to meet the desired operational objectives under a wide range of the operating conditions is achieved by supervised reconfiguration of the agents. Recently proposed robustly feasible model predictive control technology with soft switching mechanisms between different control strategies is applied to implement the soft and robustly feasible agent reconfiguration, which is adequate to current operational conditions. Next developing the multiagent structures, which are suitable for monitoring, control and security of an overall \{CIS\} is discussed. It is based on the distributed structuring the agent layers. The proposals are illustrated by applications to the integrated wastewater treatment case-study system and drinking water distribution system. },

  Abstract                 = {Autonomous driving is one of the most interesting fields of research, with a number of important applications, like agricultural, military and, most significantly, safety. This paper addresses the problem of designing a general purpose path planner and its associated low level control for autonomous vehicles operating in unknown environments. Different kinds of inputs, like the results of obstacle detection, ditch localization, lane detection, and global path planning information are merged together using potential fields to build a representation of the environment in real-time; kinematically feasible trajectories, based on vehicle dynamics, are generated on a cost map. This approach demonstrated both flexibility and reliability for vehicle driving in very different environments, including extreme road conditions. This controller was extensively tested during VIAC, the VisLab Intercontinental Autonomous Challenge, a 13,000 km long test for intelligent vehicle applications. The results, collected during the development stage and the experiment itself, are presented in the final part of this article. },

  Abstract                 = {In recent years unmanned vehicles have grown in popularity, with an ever increasing number of applications in industry, the military and research within air, ground and marine domains. In particular, the challenges posed by unmanned marine vehicles in order to increase the level of autonomy include automatic obstacle avoidance and conformance with the Rules of the Road when navigating in the presence of other maritime traffic. The \{USV\} Master Plan which has been established for the \{US\} Navy outlines a list of objectives for improving autonomy in order to increase mission diversity and reduce the amount of supervisory intervention. This paper addresses the specific development needs based on notable research carried out to date, primarily with regard to navigation, guidance, control and motion planning. The integration of the International Regulations for Avoiding Collisions at Sea within the obstacle avoidance protocols seeks to prevent maritime accidents attributed to human error. The addition of these critical safety measures may be key to a future growth in demand for USVs, as they serve to pave the way for establishing legal policies for unmanned vessels. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this paper a new method for fault isolation in a class of continuous-time stochastic dynamical systems is proposed. The method is framed in the context of model-based analytical redundancy, consisting in the generation of a residual signal by means of a diagnostic observer, for its posterior analysis. Once a fault has been detected, and assuming some basic a priori knowledge about the set of possible failures in the plant, the isolation task is then formulated as a type of on-line statistical classification problem. The proposed isolation scheme employs in parallel different hypotheses tests on a statistic of the residual signal, one test for each possible fault. This isolation method is characterized by deriving for the unidimensional case, a sufficient isolability condition as well as an upperbound of the probability of missed isolation. Simulation examples illustrate the applicability of the proposed scheme. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We consider a semi-rational addiction model in which the user has perfect foresight over all things within the user’s control, but not necessarily with respect to exogenous parameter shocks, e.g., those stemming from changes in national policy. We show that addictive substances are more likely to have state-dependent solution trajectories, and that in turn can create path dependence at the macro-policy level; in particular, legalization may be an irreversible experiment. Also, in this model, shifting from a nuanced policy that differentiates between high and low intensity users, to a tougher one where the government makes life hard for every user reduces initiation considerably. However, it also may have perverse effects. In particular, we show that making the policy tougher in this way could drive some people from a “happy” stable saddle point equilibrium with moderate consumption into increasing rather than reducing their consumption and addiction stock. So implementing zero tolerance policies may increase rather than reduce aggregate drug use, depending on the population’s distribution of parameter values and initial consumption stocks. Further, we consider the impact of announcing a policy change. },

Process control should also enable that operational indices for quality and efficiency be improved continuously, while keeping the indices related to consumptions at the lowest possible level. This paper starts with a survey on the existing operational optimization and control methodologies and then presents a data-driven hybrid intelligent optimal operational control for complex industrial processes where process operational models are difficult to obtain. Applications via a hybrid simulation system and an industrial roasting process for hematite ore mineral processing are presented to demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed operational control method. Issues for future research on the optimal operational control for complex industrial processes are outlined before concluding the paper. },

  Abstract                 = {Since Boolean network is a powerful tool in describing the genetic regulatory networks, accompanying the development of systems biology, the analysis and control of Boolean networks have attracted much attention from biologists, physicists, and systems scientists. From mathematical point of view, the dynamics of a Boolean (control) network is a discrete-time logical dynamic process. This paper surveys a recently developed technique, called the algebraic approach, based on semi-tensor product. The new technique can deal with not only Boolean networks, which allow each node to take two values, but also k-valued networks, which allow each node to take k different values, and mix-valued networks, which allow nodes to take different numbers of values. The paper provides a comprehensive introduction to the new technique, including (1) mathematical background of this new technique – semi-tensor product of matrices and the matrix expression of logic; (2) dynamic models of Boolean networks, and general (multi- or mix-valued) logical networks; (3) the topological structure of Boolean networks and general networks; (4) the basic control problems of Boolean/general control networks, which include the controllability, observability, realization, stability and stabilization, disturbance decoupling, identification and optimization, etc.; (5) some other related applications. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract We analyze the observability properties of the kinematic model of an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) moving in 3D, under the influence of ocean currents, using range and depth measurements. The results obtained shed light into the types of trajectories that an \{AUV\} may be requested to undergo in order to ensure observability, which is a crucial step in the design of single or multiple beacon positioning systems. We assume that the \{AUV\} is equipped with two sensor suites: the first computes the distance (range) of the \{AUV\} to single or multiple fixed transponders, while the second measures the vehicle’s depth. In both situations, the vehicle has access to its heading angle. We further assume that the \{AUV\} undergoes maneuvers commonly known as trimming trajectories, that are naturally obtained when the inputs (thruster rpms and control surface deflections) are held constant. This is done for two main reasons: (i) the class of trajectories thus generated is sufficiently rich for a vast number of applications and (ii) from an observability-analysis standpoint they lead to mathematical tractability and allow for an intuitive physical interpretation. These facts stand in sharp contrast to common approaches adopted in the literature, where the characterization of trajectories that yield observability is only implicit and defies a simple interpretation. In the set-up adopted, the trimming trajectories are completely characterized by three variables: (a) linear body speed ‖v‖; (b) flight-path angle γ; and (c) yaw rate ψ ˙ . We assume that ‖v‖ &gt; 0, γ, and ψ ˙ are constant but otherwise arbitrary (within the constraints of the vehicle capabilities) and examine the observability of the resulting system with the two above mentioned sensor suites. We adopt definitions of observability and weak observability that seek inspiration from those proposed by Herman and Krener (1977) but reflect the fact that we consider specific kinds of maneuvers in 3D. We start with the single transponder case. For range measurements only, we show that in the absence of ocean currents the 3D kinematic model of an \{AUV\} undergoing trimming trajectories with nonzero flight-path angle and yaw rate is observable. In the case of non-zero but known ocean currents, identical results apply subject to the condition that the flight-path angle satisfies a current-related constraint. However, if the current is non-zero and unknown, the model is only weakly observable. The situation changes completely when both range and depth measurements are available. In this case, under the assumption that the yaw rate is different from zero, observability is obtained even when the flight-path angle is zero (vehicle moving in a horizontal plane) and there are non-zero unknown currents. These obvious advantages are lost if yaw rate is equal to zero, for in this case the model is only weakly observable. In all situations where the model is weakly observable we give a complete characterization of the sets of states that are indistinguishable from a given initial state. Finally, we show that the extended model that is obtained by considering multiple (at least two) transponders is observable in all situations if the yaw rate is different from zero. },

  Abstract                 = {With the rise of the Internet, competitiveness is pressuring enterprises to build better solutions with fewer resources, following new trends and supporting new platforms and methodologies. On the other hand, legislation and regulations are updating frequently and deeply, and demanding rapid compliance from enterprises. These frequent business changes shake all the interoperability links between the enterprises, leading to periods of adaptation where business operation is not possible. The urge to rapidly regain interoperability often leads to unfounded, poorly-chosen solutions, which lead to inefficiency and rework. This paper proposes that the best way to have a strong interoperable environment is to perform constant, periodic maintenance operations in order to adapt enterprises to their surrounding ecosystem. It introduces NEGOSEIO, a framework that promotes continuous improvement and adaptation towards the management of interoperability on enterprise systems, and which has negotiations as a core mechanism to handle inconsistencies and solutions for the detected interoperability problems. Following this approach, enterprises shall become more adaptable to changes and external factors, consequently developing resilient and efficient interactions with its supply chain. The paper validates the framework with its application in a real business case of aerospace mission design on the European Space Agency (ESA). },

Such failures lead to a strong interaction between loads and aeroelasticity and must be quickly detected and passivated.

The proposed technique has been developed within \{ADDSAFE\} project (a collaborative project supported by the European Seventh Framework Program: Advanced Fault Diagnosis for Sustainable Flight Guidance and Control). A robust finite-time differentiator is used to estimate derivatives in a noisy environment. Fault reconstruction is next achieved by solving on-line a nonlinear equation using a gradient descent method. Finally, fault detection and confirmation stage is based on the decision making rules currently used for in-service Airbus \{A380\} airplane. Robustness and performance of the proposed fault detection scheme are tested using a high fidelity benchmark and intensive Monte Carlo simulations for several flight scenarios as specified within \{ADDSAFE\} project. },

  Abstract                 = {In nanotechnology applications, nanopositioning, i.e., nanometer-scale precision control at dimensions of less than 100 nm, plays a central role. One can view nanopositioners as precision mechatronics systems aiming at moving objects over a certain distance with a resolution that could be as low as a fraction of an Ångström. Actuation, position sensing and feedback control are the key components of nanopositioners that determine how successfully the stringent requirements on resolution, accuracy, stability, and bandwidth are achieved. Historically, nanopositioning has played a critical role in scanning probe microscopy (SPM), and it appears that it will play a crucial role in emerging applications such as lithography tools and semiconductor inspection systems, as well as in molecular biology, nanofabrication, and nanomanufacturing. Moreover, it is becoming an important requirement in storage systems, ranging from novel probe-based storage devices to mechatronic tape-drive systems, to support the high areal density or storage capacity needs. This paper will review control-related research in nanopositioning for two extreme cases of data-storage systems, namely, in probe and in tape storage. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper addresses the problem of fault detection and isolation of wind turbines using a mixed Bayesian/Set-membership approach. Modeling errors are assumed to be unknown but bounded, following the set-membership approach. On the other hand, measurement noise is also assumed to be bounded, but following a statistical distribution inside the bounds. To avoid false alarms, the fault detection problem is formulated in a set-membership context. Regarding fault isolation, a new fault isolation scheme that is inspired on the Bayesian fault isolation framework is developed. Faults are isolated by matching the fault detection test results, enhanced by a complementary consistency index that measures the certainty of not being in a fault situation, with the structural information about the faults stored in the theoretical fault signature matrix. The main difference with respect to the classical Bayesian approach is that only models of fault-free behavior are used. Finally, the proposed \{FDI\} method is assessed against the wind turbine \{FDI\} benchmark proposed in the literature, where a set of realistic fault scenarios in wind turbines are proposed. },

In particular, they can be used for Automatic Target Recognition (ATR) in the context of Mine Countermeasures. Currently, \{ATR\} techniques are applied to raw data which generates many false positives and the need for human supervision. Mosaicing \{FLS\} data increases target contrast and thus reduces false positive rate. Moreover, it implies a considerable data size reduction which is important if one thinks of exchange of data in real time through an acoustic channel with very limited bandwidth. Results of applying a real-time mosaicing algorithm to \{FLS\} data generated during Mine Countermeasures missions are shown and discussed thoroughly in this article. },

The required cultural shift needs challenging action that will involve deeply software and hardware aspect of manufacturing processes. In this paper, the software part of the matter is addressed by proposing a product centric ontology, in which concepts of product, processes and resources are associated to functions and sustainable manufacturing knowledge. The aim is to design a knowledge-based system that, simulating a sustainable manufacturing expert, is able to automatically identify change opportunities and to propose alternatives on the basis of the existing production scenario. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The knowledge reuse and mapping are among the most important concerns related to the design knowledge representation. In this paper, authors focus on the importance of one specific property of a design knowledge representation: the unambiguity. Authors show (1) how the ambiguity of the representation can increase the risk of a failure in the reuse and mapping processes, (2) how most of works in the literature use formal logic constructs and finally (3) how the use of these can increase the risk of ambiguity. On the basis of these remarks, an overview on the works on the anti-logicist architecture is provided: the systems based on this architecture show an intelligent behaviour without using logic constructs. An analysis and a transposition of the anti-logicist principles are then performed to build a framework allowing to represent design knowledge without logic constructs. To do so (1) main concepts are formalised in a conceptual model; (2) an algorithm has been designed to map pieces of knowledge based only on the representation syntax; (3) two instantiations of the framework are showed using a \{CAD\} instantiation. Finally, the limits of the current deployment of the framework and the research perspectives are discussed. },

The basic principle is that induced eddy currents are used to heat a ferromagnetic material as it passes through a series of coils. Because of the importance of such systems, there has been on-going interest in their design and operation. Past work includes model development from physical principles and optimal design of operational practices. However, previous work has invariably been based on open-loop strategies. Our work is aimed at the design of a closed-loop control strategy incorporating feedback from the available measurements. This paper reports initial work including model development and calibration together with preliminary control system design. Proposed future work includes full scale industrial implementation. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Large scale systems (LSS) have been traditionally characterized by a large number of variables, nonlinearities and uncertainties. Their decomposition into smaller, more manageable subsystems, possibly organized in a hierarchical structure, has been associated with intense and time – critical information exchange and with the need for efficient and coordination mechanisms. A critical overview of the different theories and algorithms for \{LSS\} is provided. The issue of system complexity has become transparent. As the complexity of such systems increase and the presence of uncertainties play a role on the performance of \{LSS\} and HMS, new system theoretic methods become more crucial and are urgently needed. Intelligent Systems (IS) and Fuzzy Cognitive Maps (FCM) theories are such new theoretic approaches in modeling Large Scale Dynamic Complex Systems (LSDCS). An \{FCM\} is based on fuzzy logic and Neural Networks. \{FCM\} integrates the accumulated experience and knowledge on the operation of the system, as a result of the methods by which it is constructed. The new theories of \{FCMs\} are reviewed and used to model \{LSS\} and Dynamical Hierarchical Control Systems. A number of applications in using \{FCM\} to model complex systems from industrial processes economics, energy, environment, health international relations and political developments are mentioned. New challenges and research opportunities are presented and discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Anomaly detection is addressed within a statistical framework. Often the statistical model is composed of two types of parameters: the informative parameters and the nuisance ones. The nuisance parameters are of no interest for detection but they are necessary to complete the model. In the case of unknown, non-random and non-bounded nuisance parameters, their elimination is unavoidable. Some approaches based on the assumption that the nuisance parameters belonging to a subspace interfere with the informative ones in a linear manner, use the theory of invariance to reject the nuisance. Unfortunately, this can lead to a serious degradation of the detector capacity because some anomalies are masked by nuisance parameters. Nevertheless, in many cases the physical nature of nuisance parameters is (partially) known, and this a priori knowledge permits to define lower and upper bounds for the nuisance parameters. The goal of this paper is to study the statistical performances of the constrained generalized likelihood ratio test used to detect an additive anomaly in the case of bounded nuisance parameters. An example of the integrity monitoring of \{GNSS\} train positioning illustrates the relevance of the proposed method. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The paper considers the relationship between stereotyping, scapegoating, unethical behaviour and instability and shows how stereotyping and scapegoating can contribute to national and international instability. It presents a revised version of a three-part model of conflict previously developed by the author, with the components of an issue of dispute, a context which favours violence over peaceful resolution, and a trigger event, and shows how some of the theories of scapegoating and the resulting violence fit into this model. It also presents a new three-level model of the factors which lead to stereotyping at the individual, organisational or communal, and wider society levels. The paper also discusses potential solutions to current vicious cycles in which unethical behaviour, stereotyping and scapegoating promote or lead to instability. The role of multi-loop action learning and organisations such as \{TECIS\} (IFAC Technical Committee 9.5 on Technology, Culture and International Stability, formerly SWIIS) are highlighted in providing support for whistleblowing, responsibility and accountability at both the collective and individual levels, a strengthening of both individual and group identities and increasing respect for currently stereotyped and discriminated against out-groups, which will reduce their vulnerability to scapegoating. },

  Abstract                 = {Decisions in supply chain planning and control are interconnected and depend on tackling uncertainties and dynamics. From this perspective, control theory (CT) is an interesting research avenue for the supply chain management (SCM). In this paper, the applicability of optimal \{CT\} to \{SCM\} is investigated. Our analysis is based on the fundamentals of control and systems theory and experimental modeling. The paper describes important issues and perspectives that delineate dynamics in supply chains, identifies and systemizes different streams in application of \{CT\} to production, logistics, and \{SCM\} in the period from 1960 to 2011. It derives some classifications, performs a critical analysis, and discusses further researches. Some drawbacks and missing links in the literature are pointed out. Several crucial application areas of control theory to \{SCM\} are discussed. Subsequently, optimal program control, challenges and advantages of its application in the \{SCM\} are addressed. It is shown how optimal program control can be applied to adaptive supply chain planning. In addition, it is concluded that with the help of CT, robustness, adaptability, and resilience of supply chains can be investigated in their consistency with operations planning and execution control within a conceptually and mathematically integrated framework. However, although \{SCs\} resemble control systems, they have some peculiarities which do not allow a direct application of \{CT\} methods. In this setting, further development of interdisciplinary approaches to supply chain optimization is argued. An extended co-operation between control and supply chain experts may have the potential to introduce more realism to the dynamic planning and models and improve real-time supply chain control policies. },

This paper focusses on key projects within this partnership, serving Airbus centres of competence in France, Germany and the UK. Goals range from improving efficiency (e.g. automated formation flight) to improvements in safety (e.g. automatic return to flight envelope) and general automation (e.g. automatic in-flight refuelling). Where appropriate, it is illustrated how detailed analysis and the application of advanced techniques may often lead to relatively simple answers and quite general conclusions. },

Reinforcement learning is bridging the gap between traditional optimal control, adaptive control and bio-inspired learning techniques borrowed from animals. This work is highlighting some of the key techniques presented by well known researchers from the combined areas of reinforcement learning and optimal control theory. At the end, an example of an implementation of a novel model-free Q-learning based discrete optimal adaptive controller for a humanoid robot arm is presented. The controller uses a novel adaptive dynamic programming (ADP) reinforcement learning (RL) approach to develop an optimal policy on-line. The \{RL\} joint space tracking controller was implemented for two links (shoulder flexion and elbow flexion joints) of the arm of the humanoid Bristol-Elumotion-Robotic-Torso \{II\} (BERT II) torso. The constrained case (joint limits) of the \{RL\} scheme was tested for a single link (elbow flexion) of the \{BERT\} \{II\} arm by modifying the cost function to deal with the extra nonlinearity due to the joint constraints. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper investigates sub-optimal time-domain reactive control of wave energy devices based on real-time up-wave surface elevation information. The paper first presents the overall approach required for such control, and recalls the need for future force and response information due to the causality of the radiation force and the non-causality of the exciting force (in relation to the wave profile at device centroid). The present approach constitutes a long-wave approximation, and is based on linearized wave propagation and device dynamics models. The long-wave approximation allows direct use of the instantaneous up-wave surface-elevation measurement. For predominantly heaving axisymmetric primary energy converters in an approximately uni-directional irregular incident wave field, the amount of cumulative reactive energy is compared with the cumulative absorbed energy. Calculations are carried out for a heaving axisymmetric buoy, when floating and when fully submerged. Oscillations are assumed to be unconstrained, so as to obtain a basic understanding of the best performance improvements and the implementation challenges associated with the present control approach. Although the net reactive energy is zero in the absence of actuator losses, it is concluded, that the reactive force magnitudes and reactive energy requirements should be an important design-level consideration. Time-domain calculations show that the reactive energy requirements for the submerged buoy may be significantly greater (compared with the floating buoy) in spectra with energy periods ≥ 13 s. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Collaboration between enterprises has moved from regional and national environments to a global one. This has tremendously increased the need for information exchange between collaborating partners. However, non-compatible (heterogeneous) \{ICT\} environments and inconsistent semantic and syntax of information to be exchanged are very often barriers in the interoperation process. Nevertheless, the relevant semantic information is usually collected in enterprise models. This information, amended by the corresponding syntax, can be collected in Object Capability Profiles to describe the required and provided information to be exchanged by the partners. An even more elaborate solution could be a new model view that collects all information needed to support intra- and inter-enterprise information exchanges. The authors first propose Object Capability Profiles for inter-organisational communication or interoperation applied to \{CIMOSA\} and the related international standard CEN/ISO 19440. Object Capability Profiles of objects potentially involved in information exchange will identify both semantic and syntax of the information to be exchanged. Comparison between required and provided information will detect any mismatch between the two and would allow automatic or manual corrections. Second, collaboration aspects are proposed to be modelled in a specific modelling view called Collaboration View. After recalling basics of the \{CIMOSA\} modelling language, the paper presents a proposal for both the Object Capability Profiling and the Collaboration View. A simplified illustrative example demonstrates the applicability of the two proposals. },

Such systems typically take the form of nonlinear \{ODEs\} (ordinary differential equations) with delays and nonlinear \{PDEs\} (partial differential equations). In this article we review several representative but general results on nonlinear control in the infinite-dimensional setting. First we present designs for nonlinear \{ODEs\} with constant, time-varying or state-dependent input delays, which arise in numerous applications of control over networks. Second, we present a design for nonlinear \{ODEs\} with a wave (string) \{PDE\} at its input, which is motivated by the drilling dynamics in petroleum engineering. Third, we present a design for systems of (two) coupled nonlinear first-order hyperbolic PDEs, which is motivated by slugging flow dynamics in petroleum production in off-shore facilities. Our design and analysis methodologies are based on the concepts of nonlinear predictor feedback and nonlinear infinite-dimensional backstepping. We present several simulation examples that illustrate the design methodology. },

Animals in groups, from bird flocks to fish schools, employ decentralized strategies and have limitations on sensing, computation, and actuation. Yet, at the level of the group, they are known to manage a variety of challenging tasks quickly, accurately, robustly and adaptively in an uncertain and changing environment. In this paper we review recent work on models and methods for studying the mechanisms of collective migration and collective decision-making in high-performing animal groups. Through bifurcation analysis we prove systematically how behavior depends on parameters that model the system and the environment. These connections lay the foundations for proving systematic control design methodologies that endow engineered multi-agent systems with the remarkable features of animal group dynamics. },

The computation occurs through local exchange of information only, namely the information exchange takes place only between agents which are neighbors with respect to a graph representing the system communication architecture. Several performance metrics have been proposed for the evaluation of this algorithm. Particularly interesting and challenging is to relate them to the communication topology. Different performance metrics may yield different answers in comparing alternative communication topologies. In this paper, we present a few performance metrics and we show how these metrics are related to the communication topology. In particular, when available, we present bounds which permit to relate performance and topology for general graphs, for graphs with symmetries, called d-dimensional tori, and for geometric graphs. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract A one-to-many, multiscale model predictive control (MPC) cascade is proposed for closing the gap between production planning and process control. The gap originates from the fact that planning and control use models at different scales, and the gap has existed since the first planning tool was deployed. Multiscaleness has been at the core of the challenge to coordinating heterogeneous solution layers, and there has been a lack of systematic treatment for multiscaleness in a control system. The proposed \{MPC\} cascade is devised as a plantwide master \{MPC\} controller cascading on top of multiple (n) slave \{MPC\} controllers.11 The technical terms, “master controller” and “slave controller,” have been long used in practice and literature, and no social connotation is intended here. The master can use a coarse-scale, single-period planning model as the gain matrix of its dynamic model, and it then can control the same set of variables that are only monitored by the planning tool. Each slave controller, using a fine-scale model, performs two functions: (1) model predictive control for a process unit, and (2) computation of proxy limits that represent the current constraints inside the slave. The master's economic optimizer amends the single-period planning optimization in real time with the slave's proxy limits, and the embedded planning model is thus reconciled with the \{MPC\} models for process units in the sense that the master's optimal solution now honors the slave's constraints. With this new approach, the proposed \{MPC\} cascade becomes the plantwide closed-loop control system that performs the reconciled planning optimization in its master controller and carries out the just-in-time production plan through its slave controllers. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In the classical electricity grid power demand is nearly instantaneously matched by power supply. In this paradigm, the changes in power demand in a low voltage distribution grid are essentially nothing but a disturbance that is compensated for by control at the generators. The disadvantage of this methodology is that it necessarily leads to a transmission and distribution network that must cater for peak demand. So-called smart meters and smart grid technologies provide an opportunity to change this paradigm by using demand side energy storage to moderate instantaneous power demand so as to facilitate the supply-demand match within network limitations. A receding horizon model predictive control method can be used to implement this idea. In this paradigm demand is matched with supply, such that the required customer energy needs are met but power demand is moderated, while ensuring that power flow in the grid is maintained within the safe operating region, and in particular peak demand is limited. This enables a much higher utilisation of the available grid infrastructure, as it reduces the peak-to-base demand ratio as compared to the classical control methodology of power supply following power demand. This paper investigates this approach for matching energy demand to generation in the last mile of the power grid while maintaining all network constraints through a number of case studies involving the charging of electric vehicles in a typical suburban low voltage distribution network in Melbourne, Australia. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Classical applications of control engineering and information and communication technology (ICT) in production and logistics are often done in a rigid, centralized and hierarchical way. These inflexible approaches are typically not able to cope with the complexities of the manufacturing environment, such as the instabilities, uncertainties and abrupt changes caused by internal and external disturbances, or a large number and variety of interacting, interdependent elements. A paradigm shift, e.g., novel organizing principles and methods, is needed for supporting the interoperability of dynamic alliances of agile and networked systems. Several solution proposals argue that the future of manufacturing and logistics lies in network-like, dynamic, open and reconfigurable systems of cooperative autonomous entities. The paper overviews various distributed approaches and technologies of control engineering and \{ICT\} that can support the realization of cooperative structures from the resource level to the level of networked enterprises. Standard results as well as recent advances from control theory, through cooperative game theory, distributed machine learning to holonic systems, cooperative enterprise modeling, system integration, and autonomous logistics processes are surveyed. A special emphasis is put on the theoretical developments and industrial applications of Robustly Feasible Model Predictive Control (RFMPC). Two case studies are also discussed: (i) a holonic, PROSA-based approach to generate short-term forecasts for an additive manufacturing system by means of a delegate multi-agent system (D-MAS); and (ii) an application of distributed \{RFMPC\} to a drinking water distribution system. },

To explore the opportunity afforded by emerging technologies, this work developed an experimental automated emergency response system. Given a set of requests from the field and infrastructure information, a high-level optimization method generates a mission plan for a fleet of autonomous vehicles, including ground vehicles, fixed-wing aircraft, and delivery rotorcraft. The mission plan assigns vehicles to a list of functions and locations to be visited. Internet technology integrates the various system elements and provides a unifying environment for the physical and the modeled world in cyberspace. Guidance and control enable the vehicles to autonomously execute their plans. The movements of the fleet vehicles including their dynamic behavior are illustrated in a virtual reality interface. Preliminary experiments with a small fleet of simulated vehicles show the feasibility of such an approach. },

Our method consists to transform the optimal control problem of a delayed differential equation with mixed control-state constraints to a nondelayed problem in order to derive necessary optimality conditions. This theory is applied to a deterministic \{HBV\} model with two constant delays. We derive conditions under which is optimal to eradicate \{HBV\} within the body of a host. Through numerical simulations, we found that the best control strategy to reduce the \{HBV\} infection is the combination of treatment in blocking new infection and treatment in inhibiting viral production. },

Controllers based on Lyapunov’s direct method have been synthesized before for this class of nonlinear systems to enforce asymptotic stability in the presence of bounded inputs. However, none of these controllers accounts explicitly for state constraints. In order to address this task, we propose an optimization-based design method for which two properties will be guaranteed simultaneously despite parametric uncertainty, namely, closed-loop stability with bounded inputs and feasibility of the transient in the presence of state constraints. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this paper, a novel robust sensor fault tolerant control strategy for systems with linear parameter varying (LPV) uncertainty model description is proposed. The strategy combines a robust fault detection and identification (FDI) unit based on an invariant-set approach with controller reconfiguration based on the use of a virtual sensor. The robust \{FDI\} unit employs a bank of observers that can detect faulty and healthy situations based on the separation of relevant sets, whose computation takes into account system disturbances and model uncertainty. The closed-loop system is reconfigured by means of a virtual sensor which is adapted to the fault situation detected by the \{FDI\} unit. The \{FDI\} and virtual sensor modules are designed using polytopic \{LPV\} techniques and bilinear matrix inequalities. The resulting robust fault tolerant control scheme is guaranteed to preserve boundedness of the closed-loop system trajectories under a wide range of sensor fault scenarios. The performance of the proposed scheme is illustrated by a simulation example. },

Unfortunately, this continuous change requirement affects the capacity of the enterprise to effectively interoperate internally and externally.

It is essential that such concerns are identified and addressed in a sustainable manner, i.e. taking into account the life cycles of all entities involved as their interoperability capabilities and requirements change along their lives. This paper focuses on interoperability issues specific to standards and proposes a novel and original way forward based on principles tested in previous case studies combining elements from the Enterprise Interoperability, Architecture and Integration, Collaborative Networks and Artificial Intelligence bodies of knowledge. },

The current industrial approach is to use condition monitoring systems, which runs in parallel with the wind turbine control system, using expensive additional sensors. An alternative would be to use the existing measurements which are normally available for the wind turbine control system. The usage of these sensors instead would cut down the cost of the wind turbine by not using additional sensors. One of these available measurements is the generator speed, in which changes in the gear-box resonance frequency can be detected. Two different time–frequency based approaches are presented in this paper. One is a filter based approach and the other is based on a Karhunen–Loeve basis. Both of them detect the gear-box fault with an acceptable detection delay of maximum 100s, which is neglectable compared with the fault developing time. },

The increasing interest in \{SMC\} is because of its interesting features such as invariance, robustness, order reduction and control chattering. Particularly robustness of \{SM\} approach with respect to parameter variations and external disturbance is vital for the control system. The review covers the sensorless \{SMC\} schemes by integrating controller and observer design to guarantee convergence of the estimates to the real states. It also covers the chattering problems, encountered often in \{SMC\} area dealt by using an asymptotic observer. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The paper addresses the single range observability analysis of a kinematics model of cooperating underactuated underwater vehicles. Teams of underwater vehicles that communicate with each other may be able to access and exchange their relative distances through, by example, acoustic signal time-of-flight measurements. Such relative distance measurements together with vehicle’s attitude and velocity information may be used onboard to implement a navigation filter to estimate the vehicle’s relative positions and orientations. A pre-requisite for successfully designing such navigation filters is to assess the systems observability properties. Contrary to the majority of existing studies on single range observability, the paper considers a more realistic underactuated kinematics model for slender body autonomous underwater vehicles rather than a simple point mass model. The paper extends previous results building on an augmented state technique allowing to reformulate the nonlinear observability problem in terms of a linear time varying one. As a result, all possible (globally) unobservable motions are characterized in terms of the systems’ initial conditions and velocity commands within the class of interest. The fundamental results reported are also illustrated by numerical simulations providing evidence of different motions generating the same output, namely lacking observability. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The long term of this ongoing research has to do with increasing degree of autonomy for robots involved in underwater intervention missions. Bearing in mind that the specific mission to face has been the intervention on a panel, in this paper some results in different development stages are presented by using the real mechatronics and the panel mockup. Furthermore, some details are highlighted describing two methodologies implemented for the required visually-guided manipulation algorithms. These algorithms are used to correct problems caused by a bad initialization or miscalibration of the arm. They consist of detecting a marker placed in a known position of the arm and updating the value of each joint after any detection. A roadmap explaining the different testbeds used for experimental validation, in increasing complexity order, is also presented. It is worth mentioning that the aforementioned results would be impossible without previously generated know-how for both the complete developed mechatronics for the autonomous underwater vehicle for intervention, and the required 3D simulation tool. In summary, thanks to the implemented approach, the intervention system is able to control the way in which the gripper approximates and manipulates the two panel devices (i.e. a valve and a connector) in an autonomous manner. Results in different scenarios demonstrate the reliability and feasibility of this autonomous intervention system in water tank and pool conditions. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The \{APS\} (Advanced Planning and Scheduling) systems are widely used by companies; however, the traditional \{APS\} systems cannot deal with problems whose the due date is a strong restriction. The problem derives from the way companies use their scheduling heuristics. This paper addresses this problem by using the concept of time windows with the constraint programming mechanism. A procedure is shown to generate the time windows and how they can be used for the \{APS\} systems. The \{APS\} heuristic approach that uses the concepts of time windows with constraint programming is introduced to solve problems for which the due date is a strong restriction. These heuristics, with tasks allocation either at the beginning or at the end of the task time window, eliminate the need for a priority scheme. To illustrate the advantage of the proposal, some examples are presented. },

Commonly used multivariate statistical tools are introduced to characterize normal variations and detect abnormal changes. Further, diagnosis methods are surveyed and analyzed, with fault detectability and fault identifiability for rigorous analysis.

An extension of recent results about the design of stable interval observers for linear systems with additive time-varying zonotopic input bounds is proposed. It allows the explicit computation of adaptive thresholds ensuring a guaranteed robustness with respect to structured and bounded disturbances which can be not only additive but also multiplicative. Moreover, the constant term (center) of the uncertain time-varying state matrix need not be diagonalizable thanks to results based on a Jordan decomposition. A sufficient condition not only ensuring the stability of the initial uncertain model but also the nondivergence of the computed adaptive thresholds is given. A numerical example dealing with fault detection in an electrical drive illustrates the proposed scheme. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract While commercially available \{AUVs\} are routinely used in survey missions, a new set of applications exist which clearly demand intervention capabilities. The maintenance of permanent underwater observatories, submerged oil wells, cabled sensor networks, pipes and the deployment and recovery of benthic stations are a few of them. These tasks are addressed nowadays using manned submersibles or work-class ROVs, equipped with teleoperated arms under human supervision. Although researchers have recently opened the door to future I-AUVs, a long path is still necessary to achieve autonomous underwater interventions. This paper reviews the evolution timeline in autonomous underwater intervention systems. Milestone projects in the state of the art are reviewed, highlighting their principal contributions to the field. To the best of the authors’ knowledge, only three vehicles have demonstrated some autonomous intervention capabilities so far: ALIVE, \{SAUVIM\} and \{GIRONA\} 500, being the last one the lightest one. In this paper \{GIRONA\} 500 I-AUV is presented and its software architecture discussed. Recent results in different scenarios are reported: (1) valve turning and connector plugging/unplugging while docked to a subsea panel, (2) free floating valve turning using learning by demonstration, and (3) multipurpose free-floating object recovery. The paper ends discussing the lessons learned so far. },

This article shows upcoming demands on automation systems and discusses new strategies for software deployment of automation applications and communication systems to fulfill these requirements. This includes handling of different types of functional coupling, e.g. loose coupling with internet/web based technologies for interaction and information management. In addition the current device models offering specific device functions have to be adapted to the new \{CPS\} approach. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Increasingly, there is a focus on utilising renewable energy resources in a bid to fulfil increasing energy requirements and mitigate the climate change impacts of fossil fuels. While most renewable resources are free, the technology used to usefully convert such resources is not and there is an increasing focus on improving the conversion economy and efficiency. To this end, advanced control technology can have a significant impact and is already a relatively mature technology for wind turbines. Though wave energy systems are still in their infancy, significant benefits have been shown to accrue from the appropriate use of control technology. To date, the application communities connected with wind and wave energy have had little communication, resulting in little cross fertilisation of control ideas and experience, particularly from the more mature wind area to wave. This paper examines the application of control technology across both domains, both from a comparative and contrasting point of view, with the aim of identifying commonalities in control objectives and potential solutions. Key comparative reference points include the articulation of the stochastic resource models, specification of control objectives, development of realistic device models, and development of solution concepts. Not least, in terms of realistic system requirements are the set of physical and legislative constraints under which such renewable energy systems must operate, and the need to provide reliable and fault-tolerant control solutions, which respect the often remote and relatively inaccessible location of many offshore deployments. },

The solution relies on virtual actuators, an active fault-hiding method that reconfigures the faulty plant instead of the controller. The main contribution of the paper consists in the design of the virtual actuators with guarantees that, if at the fault isolation time the closed-loop system state is inside a region defined by a value of the Lyapunov function, the state trajectory will converge to zero despite the appearance of faults within a predefined set. In addition, the design of the nominal controller is performed so as to maximize the tolerated delay between the fault occurence and its isolation. Finally, the theoretical results are demonstrated and illustrated using an example. },

  Abstract                 = {A revolution in control theory thought happened in the early 1970s when the dominant focus of research shifted from optimality to robustness in response to unexpected failures of optimal control theory to produce feedback control designs capable of tolerating normal differences between design models and reality. The robustness concept has since become such an integral part of present day control theory that it is difficult to imagine that time long ago when the concept lacked a clear mathematical representation and the tools of multivariable robustness analysis were yet to be identified. We shall revisit that time to examine the events that facilitated, and necessitated, this remarkable paradigm shift. Next, looking to the future, we will consider how failures of robust control designs to cope with incorrect uncertainty estimates are beginning to spur control theorists to consider data-driven problem formulations for estimation and control that tacitly question the roles of basic concepts like true model and uncertainty bounds, stochastic noise models and even Bayesian probability. We will discuss how and why Karl Popper’s scientific logic of unfalsification seems to be emerging as a central concept in these data-driven problem formulations, and how the unfalsification concept might again shift the focus of mathematical research in the areas of estimation and control. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Robotics nowadays is a mature discipline. For its widespread employment in real civilian scenarios, in close contacts with humans, additional efforts are needed to establish standards and common procedures to evaluate and assess robot performance. A methodology for performance evaluation is here proposed and some indices are formalized for the evaluation of robot behaviors against different criteria. The indices are tested on a number of experiments with unmanned marine vehicles, from different field campaigns and in different scenarios. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Modeling, analysis and control of networked control systems (NCS) have recently emerged as topics of significant interest to the control community. The defining feature of any \{NCS\} is that information is exchanged using digital band-limited serial communication channel among systems components and usually shared by other feedback control loops. Conventional control theory with many ideal assumptions, such as synchronized control and non-delayed sensing and actuation must be revisited so that the limitations on communication capabilities within the control design framework can be integrated. Recent achievements showed that it is possible to solve communication problems and control problems simultaneously, thus contributing to a more efficient \{NCS\} design. This paper aims at giving an overview of Fault Diagnosis methods dealing with enhancement of robustness against network induced effects and introducing co-design approaches making it possible to solve communication problems and control problems simultaneously, thus contributing to a more efficient design. },

It will be shown that sliding mode techniques have the advantages that several actuator faults of the wind turbine drive train can be simultaneously reconstructed with one and the same observer and directly applied for fault compensation. Furthermore, a simple compensation approach is implemented by subtracting the reconstructed faults obtained from the (faulty) inputs. These corrected inputs act on the system as virtual actuators, such that the originally designed controller for the nominal, i.e. fault-free situation, can still be used. The fault reconstruction and fault tolerant control strategy are tested in simulations with several faults of different types. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract This paper proposes a technique for optimizing the power generated from stationary stochastic vibratory disturbances, using a resonant energy harvester. Although the theory is general, the target application of the paper concerns ocean wave energy harvesting. The control technique involves the use of a causal discrete-time feedback algorithm to dynamically optimize the power extracted from the waves. The theory assumes that the input impedance of the harvester is known precisely, but that a priori models are unavailable for the characterization of the stochastic behavior of the incident waves as well as the transfer functions characterizing their hydrodynamic excitation of the system. For these assumptions, we develop an adaptive control technique, which adapts the feedback law at each time step based on updated estimates for the stochastic disturbance model, obtained through a subspace-based system identification algorithm. The technique is demonstrated on a simulation example pertaining to a cylindrical surface-floating wave energy converter in heave. },

  Abstract                 = {Industries nowadays have more insight into corporate environmental, social and economic sustainability than ever before. Sustainability issues in various industries are all about choices – finding ways to be more strategic and reducing waste and energy, while benefiting the bottom line. Because of the complexity of sustainability decisions and strategies, these insights call for applying advanced control techniques. In this article we review the concepts of sustainability and its practical issues, specifically focusing on the issues of supply networks. Sustainability issues are usually complex because beyond their inherent challenges, there are conflicts among stakeholders within organizations and between organizations; hence, more useful methods are required for effective solutions. We consider Decision Support Systems (DSSs) to help optimize solutions related with sustainability issues, and review their concepts and usefulness based on previous work. We also suggest strategies applying the Collaborative Control Theory (CCT) principles to augment \{DSS\} by a new Sustainability – Decision Support Protocol (S-DSP) in order to overcome certain weaknesses. To model and illustrate the benefit of S-DSP as a control protocol, two practical supply delivery/production problems are analyzed. The results highlight how better collaborative solutions can be achieved to maximize the sustainability of supply networks. It is envisioned that sustainability decision support by such cyber-supported collaboration protocols will contribute to overcome the emerging challenges of sustainability planning and control. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract It is certainly worth remarking on half a century of a work defining a landmark in Discrete Event Dynamic Systems (DEDS) theory. This invited contribution aims to combine some historical facts with elements of a conceptual view on concurrent DEDS, giving pointers about the development of the field. Simplifying the historical trajectory, it can be said that the seed sown by Carl Adam Petri in 1962 first grew in America (essentially until the mid 1970s), where an appropriate intellectual ambiance existed in computer science, business process management and switching systems design. Later, many other new lines of activity, including logic control and performance evaluation, flourished in Europe. Today Petri nets are widespread all over the world. The conceptual paradigm of Petri nets deals inter alia with modeling, logical analysis, performance evaluation, parametric optimization, dynamic control, diagnosis and implementation issues. In summary, multidisciplinary in themselves, formalisms belonging to the Petri nets paradigm may cover several phases of the life-cycle of complex DEDS. Given the hundreds of research and text monographs on Petri nets, together with the many thousands of theoretical and applied contributions on the subject, not to mention the \{ISO\} (International Organization for Standardization) or \{IEC\} (International Electrotechnical Commission) standards for the use of Petri nets in engineering, this work cannot hope to be a complete survey or a tutorial in the more classical sense. It is more of an impressionistic overview of the field. },

Two key issues are deeply investigated: individualization, needed to cope with intersubject variability, and meal compensation, interpreted as a disturbance rejection problem. The individualization is achieved either by tuning the cost function, based on few well known clinical parameters (MPC1) or through the use of an individual model obtained via system identification techniques and an optimal tuning of the cost function based on real-life experiments (MPC2). The in silico tests, performed on 4 different scenarios using a simulator equipped with 100 patients, show that the performances of \{MPC1\} are very promising, supporting its current use in an in vivo multicenter trial on 47 patients that is being carried out within the European Research Project AP@home. At the same time, further improvements are achieved by MPC2, showing that there is scope for in vivo experimentation of control strategies employing individually estimated patient models. },

Regularity conditions are given that guarantee the existence of random solutions and robustness of the Lyapunov conditions. },

For all problems general existence conditions of their solutions are given. An overview of recently developed computational methods for the synthesis of fault detection filters is presented for all formulated problems. Two remarkable computational paradigms emerged in these developments, which are instrumental in developing generally applicable, numerically reliable and computationally efficient synthesis methods. The first paradigm is the use of integrated synthesis algorithms, where the resulting fault detection filters are determined by successive updating of partial syntheses addressing specific requirements. The second paradigm is the use of the nullspace method as a first synthesis step to reduce all synthesis problems to a simple standard form which allows to easily check solvability conditions and address least order synthesis problems. },

  Abstract                 = {Data reconciliation is a well-known technique to improve accuracy and reliability of plant measurements. It relies on process models that could range from simple mass and energy conservation equations to complete causal dynamic models. Generally, precise estimates imply detailed plant models that could be difficult to build and update in practice. The trade-off between modeling efforts and estimation performances has thus lead to various approaches to deal with plant dynamics. The objective of the paper is to review and compare most common observers used for dynamic data reconciliation in the mineral and metallurgical processing industries. Comparisons are carried out using a separation unit and a flotation circuit as simulated benchmark plants. Observer performances are evaluated in terms of variance reduction. Strengths and weaknesses of the different methods are highlighted. Aspects such as estimation of model parameters, detection of gross errors, and handling of bilinear equations and plant non-linearities are discussed. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Control theory has been instrumental for the analysis and design of a number of engineering systems, including aerospace and transportation systems, robotics and intelligent machines, manufacturing chains, electrical, power, and information networks. In the past several years, the ability of de novo creating biomolecular networks and of measuring key physical quantities has come to a point in which quantitative analysis and design of biological systems is possible. While a modular approach to analyze and design complex systems has proven critical in most control theory applications, it is still subject of debate whether a modular approach is viable in biomolecular networks. In fact, biomolecular networks display context-dependent behavior, that is, the input/output dynamical properties of a module change once this is part of a network. One cause of context dependence, similar to what found in many engineering systems, is retroactivity, that is, the effect of loads applied on a module by downstream systems. In this paper, we focus on retroactivity and review techniques, based on nonlinear control and dynamical systems theory, that we have developed to quantify the extent of modularity of biomolecular systems and to establish modular analysis and design techniques. },

This paper surveys advances in pinning control approaches to making a dynamical networked system have a desired behavior. For a network with fixed topology, we review the feasibility, stability and effectiveness of pinning control. We then focus on pinning-based consensus and flocking control of mobile multi-agent networked systems. One of the main challenges with consensus and flocking control is that the topology of the corresponding dynamical network is time-varying, which depends on the states of all the agents in the network. Looking forward to the next decade, we expect to have a much deeper understanding of the relationship between the effectiveness of pinning control and the structural properties of a complex network, which may result in better control of large scale networked systems. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Models are instruments that allow agents to gain understanding and plan future steps required for being sustainable. Unfortunately, social, economical and ecological systems are in constant flux. The modelling process in a dynamic environment is a never ending, ongoing concern. As a theoretical lens for the analysis of enterprise sustainability the theory of Complex Adaptive Systems (CAS) is used. This theory allows to capture dynamic aspects in models. Theoretical aspects of \{CASs\} are briefly introduced and used to analyse learning support for the active agents in the enterprise. A learning system is conceptualised. Support for enterprise models in general and the enterprises’ active agents in particular is discussed to show how to support getting along with the dynamics of the overall system. Interoperability is derived as a key property of the overall system. Interoperability requires system-parts to be independent, while supporting the overall system’s functionality. On the one hand multi-faced problems are independently analysed by active agents. On the other hand partial solutions realised by active agents need to be interoperable on the enterprise level. Taking a \{CAS\} point of view interoperability between system parts becomes a necessity, which, if not met, might bring the overall system to a halt. Requirements and properties for a support environment for organisations’ agents to keep pace with permanent changes in their environments are described. Technologies are presented that fit to the used theoretical point of view and support both: the individual evolution and learning of agents who update local models and the interoperability between models. },

  Abstract                 = {The grown complexity of the modern enterprise poses a series of challenges, among them keeping competitiveness in the fast changing environment in which the enterprise evolves. Addressing enterprise integration is considered as a key to achieve the goal of any enterprise either it is a single or a networked enterprise. Enterprise modelling is a prerequisite to enable the common understanding of the enterprises and its various interactions in order to “provide the right information, at the right time, at the right place”. However, problems often emerge from a lack of understanding of the semantics of the elaborated models resulting from various modelling experience based on different methods and tools. This paper describes the challenges associated to semantics enactment in information systems models. To facilitate this enactment, it proposes an approach based on a fact-oriented modelling perspective. Then, it also provides an algorithm to automatically build semantic aggregates that help in highlighting enterprise models core embedded semantics. A case study on the field of \{B2M\} interoperability is performed in order to illustrate the application of the presented approach. },

We also present a different and more elegant treatment on an analytic solution to Wahba’s problem. For quaternion based control system design, we focus on some recently developed reduced quaternion models which use only vector component of the quaternion in the state space models. We discuss some new design method that has the following features: (a) it has an analytic solution of LQR, and (b) the designed system reduces disturbance effect, global stabilizes the nonlinear spacecraft system, and is robust to the modeling uncertainty. The presentation of the review is self-complete. It includes all the background information that is needed to understand the development involving the system modeling, the attitude determination, and the attitude control system design methods. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract The design of automated systems for monitoring the performance of large numbers of \{MPC\} controllers is presented. The linear-quadratic-Gaussian (LQG) system is treated first, and analytical closed-form probability densities are derived for all variables of interest. The \{MPC\} controller’s stage cost is chosen as the key performance index (KPI) to use for monitoring purposes. The stage cost is shown to have a generalized chi-squared distribution in the \{LQG\} case. The effects of nonzero, deterministic disturbances and plant/model mismatch on monitoring systems are briefly presented. The problem of determining the disturbance variances required for monitoring is briefly reviewed. Next the case of constrained, linear \{MPC\} and nonlinear \{MPC\} is discussed. In place of closed-form probability densities, online simulation is proposed as a general method for generating the statistics required for monitoring purposes. An overall conclusion of the paper is that the timing may be ideal for vendors to start offering monitoring products tailored to enhance their advanced \{MPC\} control product offerings. },

  Abstract                 = {The efficiency and effectiveness of the daily practice in orthopedic surgery depend on the availability, interoperability and unique access to a wide set of information, related to the patient’s medical record and diagnosis, domain knowledge and available resources and staff. The most important of the tangible resources, needed for the therapeutic or preventive actions are orthopedic implants. In some cases, the implants may be highly complex and customized products, which need to be manufactured (assembled) on basis of the above information in a shortest possible timeframe. In this paper, the case of the custom orthopedic implants manufacturing is described from the perspective of the collaborative enterprising, with special consideration of the interoperability issues of the involved enterprise collaboration. It is shown how the previously developed Semantic Interoperability Framework can be used to improve the efficiency of the manufacturing and other relevant processes. },

  Abstract                 = {Abstract In this paper, a distributed sensor fault detection and isolation (FDI) method is developed for a class of interconnected nonlinear uncertain systems. In the distributed \{FDI\} architecture, a \{FDI\} component is designed for each subsystem in the interconnected system. For each subsystem, its corresponding local \{FDI\} component is designed by utilizing local measurements and certain communicated information from neighboring \{FDI\} components associated with subsystems that are directly interconnected to the particular subsystem under consideration. Under certain assumptions, adaptive thresholds for distributed sensor fault detection and isolation in each subsystem are derived, ensuring robustness with respect to interactions among subsystems and system modeling uncertainty. Moreover, the fault detectability condition is rigorously investigated, characterizing the class of sensor faults in each subsystem that is detectable by the proposed distributed \{FDI\} method. Additionally, the stability and learning capability of the distributed adaptive fault isolation estimators is established. A simulation example of interconnected inverted pendulums mounted on carts is used to illustrate the effectiveness of the distributed \{FDI\} method. },
